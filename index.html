        <h1>TSUNAMIS</h1>
        <p>A tsunami is a <span class="highlight">series of waves</span> caused by <span class="highlight">earthquakes</span> or <span class="highlight">undersea volcanic eruptions</span>.</p>
        <p>Tsunamis are giant waves caused by earthquakes or volcanic eruptions under the sea. Out in the depths of the ocean, tsunami waves do not dramatically increase in height. But as the waves travel inland, they build up to higher and higher heights as the depth of the ocean decreases.</p>
        <p>The speed of tsunami waves depends on <span class="highlight">ocean depth</span> rather than the distance from the source of the wave. Tsunami waves may travel as fast as <span class="highlight">jet planes</span> over deep waters, only slowing down when reaching shallow waters.</p>
        <p>While tsunamis are often referred to as <span class="highlight">tidal waves</span>, this name is discouraged by oceanographers because tides have little to do with these giant waves.</p>
