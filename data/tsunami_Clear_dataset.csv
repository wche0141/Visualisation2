During one of the earthquakes of 245 AH, most probably in
the month of Shaban (1 to 30 November 859 AD), a strong earthquake shook the Syrian coasts from Antiochia to Akka. As-Soyuti says that this earthquake shattered a mountain near Antiochia which fell into the sea together with 1005 houses and 90 villages. El-Macin, Abul-Faragi and Tabar add that the mountain was called Acraus or Rock and that it was closer to Akka rather than to Antiochia. All writers agree that when the mountain collapsed into the sea, the water retired and then returning surged he shores. (reference #24)"

Adriatic Sea, Gulf of Venice. A strong earthquake enveloped the gulf and the north-eastern shore of the Adriatic Sea - in Istria and Dalmatia. From other data, a huge sea wave following a disastrous earthquake in the regions of Friuli and Istria, came upon the coast and devastated it; the shore of the Gulf of Venice was flooded.
<P>During the earthquake, the sky in the direction from Dalmatia to Istria assumed a bright flame - like red color, long flame - colored stripes appeared. The sea overflowed its shores, with the result that buildings were destroyed and lives were lost.
<P>In the catalogue by Caputo and Faita [1984] a supposition was made that the tsunami was caused by the April 30,793 (or 792) earthquake with its epicentre
at 45.5N, llE, i.e. located near Verona, and with a maximum intensity I=IX. In the papers by Radics [1902] and Guidoboni and Tinti [1989] it is demonstrated that this earthquake is extremely questionable and, apparently, it
was introduced into the literature by one of the medieval chroniclers in 1596 to explain why the city walls collapsed in Verona. In the paper, a proposal was made that the tsunami was possibly caused by the February, 792 earthquake
with a maximum intensity I = VIII, mentioned in the catalogue of Slovenian earthquakes [Ribaric, 1982]; however these data are also not very reliable [Von Valvasor, 1689; Radics, 1902; Ambraseys, 1962; Ann. Bibl., 1964, Nos. 1284,

Thera. At the same time as an eclipse of the Moon, probably following a subdued eruption, an islet, which became known as Theia, rose up from the sea between Thera and Therasia in the Cyclades.
<P>This event is well documented by contemporary authors, including Seneca, who confirms that it happened in his own time and during the consulship of Valerius Asiaticus (AD 46). Dio Cassius dates it Roman year 800 (AD 47), while St Jerome gives the fifth year of Olympiad CCVI (AD 45), and notes the length of the island as 30 stadia (5.5 km). Orosius (writing early in the fifth century AD) dates it to the fifth year of Claudius (AD 45-46).
<P>Since Aurelis Victor mentions that it happened on the same night as a lunar eclipse, there is a chance of dating the eruption accurately. Schove and Fletcher (1987, 9-11) derive several dates, noting that the most popular is 31 December AD 46, because this would embrace both Seneca's date of AD 46 and Dio's of AD 47. However, he thinks that 6 July AD 46 is more probable because the eclipse would have been distinctly noticeable by about 8.53 pm, and consequently more likely to be recorded.
<P>One must beware of confusing this eruption with that of Hiera in 199-198 BC, since the two occurrences were very similar in nature. Pliny mentions both, but the dates in the relevant passage are notoriously unreliable. Pliny's date, 8 July of the 110th year after the fourth year of Olympiad CXLV, works out as AD 3. This is due in part to a scribal error in an early copy of Pliny's works, when many events were assigned to Olympiad CXXXV.
<P>Modern cataloguers associated this eruption with the Crete earthquake of 62-64, dating it 53/52/66. Guidoboni (1989, 661-662), Guidoboni et al. (1994, 193-194) associate this eruption at Thera with the Crete earthquake of 62-64, dating it 53/52/66 for which I have no evidence.

The Recoleto historian, Father Diego de Santa Teresa, reports an earthquake as follows: ""[The galleon San Francisco Xavier] reached the strait of San Bernardino after a successful voyage, and, passing through it at the risk occasioned by the vicinity of so many islands, anchored near Mindoro. At midnight it was in great danger because an earthquake caused the sea to throw up breaking waves, and the galleon broke from its anchors. It would have been carried to certain destruction if it had not been saved by the Suffering Christ."" DST, p. 243. We learn from the Augustinian historian, Diaz, that the ship entered San Bernardino on June 26 and arrived at Cavite on July 23. He mentions that it was nearly wrecked in a storm off Mindoro and encountered three more typhoons before reaching Manila.
He makes no mention of an earthquake. CD, pp. 527-528. The reality of this earthquake may be reasonably doubted. In order to have the effects on the sea which Santa Teresa describes, the earthquake would have been very strong and could scarcely have escaped notice by other historians."

In Pinars earthquake catalogue, we find an earthquake
which occurred in Constantinople on April 1646. As a result of the shock 136 ships, we are informed, were thrown on land. This event we also find in Huot (1837) who adds that the earthquake shock itself was not severe. Nevertheless, the sea rushed inland so violently that 136 sailing ships were cast on shore. The original source of information seems to be a letter of Dr. Vivoli, to which unfortunately have not had access. It is quite clear that what Huot describes is the result of a seismic sea-wave which it is of interest to notice that in this case was caused by a rather mild shock.
<P>From Mallet (1858) we learn that on April 5, 1646, an earthquake occurred also in Italy. Magri (1647) says that this earthquake caused much damage in Livorno where sea-waves damaged the ships at anchor in the harbour of the town. Mallet regards these two earthquakes to have occurred simultaneously on the 5th of April 1646. On the basis of the available information on these two events it is difficult to appreciate this coincidence. If Mallets view was correct, it is difficult to distinguish whether the event of April in Constantinople was the result of a strong sea-wave which was set up by the Livorno earthquake or of a local seismic sea-wave.

Ogerius Panis and Marchisius Scriba as well as Oliverus
Scholasticus record a strong earthquake in Cyprus on May
1222, which did much damage at Lemessos, Nicosia and elsewhere. ..during this earthquake:
... the sea abandoned its habitual places and retreated
far into the open sea. Baffa (Paphos) and Limisso (Lemessos)
were then submerged by the sea ... and  ... the
harbour (of Paphos) dried up, and then the town was
submerged by the sea...
<P>
There is no doubt that this event occurred on
May 1222 AD. In all earthquake catalogues this Cyprian earthquake is dated December 25, 1222. The reason for this is that many Latin chronographers considered the shaking of Cyprus as result of the great Lombardian earthquake of 25 December 1222 which shook also Tyrol, and southern Germany and which was followed by many aftershocks till January 11, 1223. This, once more, shows how misleading was the tendency of early chroniclers to treat collectively different earthquakes.

This earthquake affected a large area in southwest Turkey and the Dodecanese Islands. Damage extended from the island of Cos and Rhodes to the Gulf of Antalya and to Cine in the north, an area of radius 90 km... Rhodes was ruined by the earthquake and the sea drew back, leaving the harbour dry... Aristides would seem to be writing about the second event [141 and 142]: he describes a seismic sea wave that destroyed Rhodes and left it ruined. This would tally with Pausania's second account, where he mentions that the cities of Rhodes were rebuilt by the emperor. (ref #9116)
<P>142 (148). Island of Rhodes. The town of Rhodes was destroyed by an earthquake, and its ruins were washed away by the wave that rushed in so quickly that the citizens suffering the earthquake had no time to find their relatives; the sea water penetrated deep into dry land for several miles. The towns on the islands of Kos, Symi, Serifos suffered from the earthquake and tsunami (ref # 2130)
<P>142. If we can trust Aristides's account, the city of Rhodes was practically devastated not so much by the earthquake as by the sea-wave which followed. Towns in the islands of Cos, Seriphos and Syme suffered heavily from both the earthquake shock and the ensued sea-wave. In Rhodes the sea advanced many miles inland and rased to the ground what ruins were left standing by the shock proper. (reference #23)

Many coeval sources report detailed description of the earthquake but only one refers that the shock was followed by a seismic sea wave. According to this source, the town of Rhodes was more devastated by the tsunami than by the shock. In Rhodes the sea advanced many miles inland. (ref #4139)

In the rhetorical speech Rodiakos of Aristides Aelius (129189 AD), communicated to the citizens of Rhodes, a strong tsunami caused by the earthquake is described (see passages 2026): <i>. . . and I remember that in that fatal noon, when the calamity that happened to you started, when the sea was calm,. . . and all the earthquake force was directed against the city. . . Then the sea water retreated and the ports dried up. . . and the ports became as the dry ground. . . And everything happened at the same moment: the earthquake of the sea, the clouds, the roaring, the lamentations, the noise of the dead bodies, the ground subsidence. . . Everything had collapsed. . . . </i> In addition, the speech of Aelius makes clear that the islands of Symi (Dodecanese) and Serifos (Cyclades) were not destructed by the earthquake as claimed by Papazachos and Papazachou (1997) who apparently misunderstood passage 38 of the speech. The estimates for the year of occurrence of this earthquake and tsunami event range about seven years around 148. Papachristodoulou (1994) prefers to call it the large shock of the middle of 2nd century AD. (reference #2840)"

An earthquake felt in Crete was associated with an abnormal fluctuation of sea level. Apollonius, an eyewitness to the event, relates that, about midday, an earthquake shook the whole island and that at Leben, on the south coast of the island, south of Gortyna, the sea receded about 7 stadia (1.3km). He adds that travelers arriving from Cydoniatis (modern Chania) in the western part of the island reported that at the same time an island rose out of the sea between Thera and Crete.
<P>The date of the event is not given, but Apollonius was in Sparta until the end of the winter of AD 61 and in the spring of the following year, AD 62, he proceeded to Crete.

<P>62 A.D. ...It is clear to us that the island of Hiera emerged in 46 AD and that the earthquake and the accompanying sea-wave at Leben, which is described by Apollonius, occurred in 62 AD. There remains, however, to identify the island alluded to by Apollonius, which should have been connected with the sea-wave at Leben. For this, we resort to Bursian (1862, p. 522) who very logically
suggests that there might have been a volcanic shoal or islet near Thera (Santorini) which following the behaviour not so uncommon with islets around Thera, sunk shortly after it emerged from the sea. As for the origin of the seismic sea-wave observed at Leben, we may say that is was of volcanic nature. (reference #23)

On the 17th (or 24th) of August, earthquakes began at Acapulco. The strongest occurred on the night of August 30-September 1 at 2:00 [local time]. It destroyed almost the entire city and was felt strongly at Mexico City. The source of the earthquake was apparently situated near Acapulco and San Marcos. The earthquake gave rise to a large tsunami. The sea at Acapulco suddenly retreated, dropping a vessel riding at anchor on the bottom of the bay. The flood tide was stronger than in 1732. The rise of water passed the maximal flood tide mark by 3-4 m. The tsunami damaged the citadel and the fortress walls and destroyed most of the homes in the city. (reference #415)

The earliest information about the earthquake of 10 September 1509 in the Sea of Marmara comes from a letter written five days after the event, dated 15 Sept 1509, by Nicolo Zustignan a Venetian in Istanbul. There can be no doubt that the correct date of the earthquake is 10 Sept 1509, at about 10 at night in the New Style (N.S.), and that, from what has already been said the date 14 Sept assigned to the event by most writers is erroneous. As a result of the earthquake, in some places in Istanbul and Pera the ground opened up and fissured, presumably along the coast of the Golden Horn. Also as a result of the earthquake the sea retreated from the shore and then returned, flooding the coast over a very large area at places that are not named. When the sea came back to its previous place, the ground near the coast opened up and was left fissured. This phenomenon was observed on both sides of the Golden Horn on the coasts of Istanbul and Pera. Modern writers claim that as a result of the earthquake the sea overtopped the sea walls of the city. This information comes from later authors, who say that the sea in the Golden Horn was so strongly shaken that it was thrown over the walls of Istanbul and Galata killing 12000 people. There is no indication <i>in primary sources</i> that the flooding of the coast of the Golden Horn by the sea at the time of the earthquake caused any damage or that the Sea of Maramara flooded the south coast of the city.

Catastrophic earthquake devastating Costantinople, Gallipoli and many other cities, particularly on the coasts of the Marmara Sea. In Costantinople thousands of houses collapsed together with a large part of the city walls. Down-town residential quarters collapsed (Antonopoulos, r417). At Costantinople, during the shock the sea rushed inland, over the walls and flooded the streets in the city as well as the settlements outside the walls. The district of Galatas was heavily damaged by the sea-wave that caused many casualties (Anonimous, r475; Knolles, r476; Lycosthenes, r487).
Near Galata and near Hereke Bay (north of gulf of Izmit) the coasts were flooded (Kuran, r388). In Yenikapi the waves overtop the sea walls whose crown height is about 6 m (Kuran, r388). (reference #4139)

up with earth. Most cities in the province of Hauran were completely destroyed. Yirka and Tyre were razed to the ground.
<P>Near the coast of Syria, after the earthquake, the water in the sea opened slightly in various places and was divided into hill-like masses, ships found themselves on dry ground; a great number of fish were thrown out on the shore. On the island of Cyprus a harbour in Papfros was dried, after which the city was flooded, like Limassol. <P>(above from reference #2130).
<P>May 22, 1202. Syrian Coasts. During the latter half of 1201 and the beginning of 1202 Syria and Palestine were shaken by a number of severe earthquakes... but on the Syrian coasts and as far as Cyprus the sea was lifted up by the shock and rushed inland; the sea in places opened up in huge masses of water big as mountains and surged the land raising to the ground buildings and filling the place with dead fish... it appears that the seismic sea-wave was felt along the coasts of Syria, from Jafa to Djebelh and also in Cyprus. (reference #26) 
<P>The occurrence of a seismic sea-wave between Cyprus and the Syrian coast may be explained through the generation of a large-scale subaqueous slide from the continental margin of Syria, triggered by the earthquake. North of Acre the continental shelf narrows to a few kilometers and off the coast of Lebanon the continental slope steepens from near Acre northwards to an average slope of 10<sup>o</sup>.
Under these circumstances, the principal cause of a seismic sea-wave is submarine slumping. The whole of that coast is certainly prone to slumping because of evaporites in the sedimentary section. (reference #2799)

<P>Michael talks also about the effects of an extraordinary storm at sea, as a result of which waves rose up (damaging waves in lakes, fjords and large reservoirs can be generated by submarine slumping of large masses of loose sediments triggered by an earthquake or by its aftershocks), flooding the land and destroying coastal towns and villages, including a fort in the region of Balqa, that is, in the Moab, a site probably somewhere near northeastern coast of the Dead Sea. <B>The storm he clearly does not associate with the earthquake </B>and this event may be as exotic as the damage caused in Constantinople and Nicae, which Michael inserts for the second time at the end of his narrative.

<P>Beirut seems to have been the worst hit. It was badly damaged by the earthquake and a sea wave, but most of the destruction seems to have resulted from the ensuing fire, which apparently raged for two months
<P>The earthquake was associated with a destructive seismic sea wave. It is said that 30000 ( sic .) people were drowned by the sea wave, since, once the sea had retreated, they had gone down to the sea bed to plunder sunken wrecks, a grossly exaggerated figure given for Beirut alone (Ant. Plac. 159160). <P><i>Note: the deaths may not be certain, as noted by reference #12645</i>
<P>Along the coast of Phoenice the sea receded for many hours by one to two miles ( sic .), stranding sailing boats in the shallows. Then the sea came back, throwing ships on land, causing great havoc before returning to its original level. A contemporary source (John Eph. NA. 489, 491) notes that the main earthquake was preceded by a shock that was responsible for setting off the seismic sea wave and that the main earthquake occurred after the sea had flooded the coast. Barring a degree of poetic licence, this statement implies two shocks within an hour."

<P>76 A.D. Cyprus, Kition, Paphos and Salamis. (reference #20)
<P>76 A.D. Cyprus, Cition, Paphos and Salamis. A disastrous earthquake occurred in Cyprus in 76 or 77 AD. This earthquake is generally dated together with a pestilence in
Rome, in 77 AD, but early chroniclers differ in it slightly. We are inclined to think rather of 76 AD as the year for this earthquake because this was the year at which the Romans transferred their mint to Cyprus and the first coins minted there are dated July 76, August 77 and September 78. It is not improbable that this transfer of the mint was connected with the measures taken to relieve the island after the earthquake which is generally dated 767 AD but may have taken place a year earlier. Some few early chroniclers may have put the earthquake in 77 AD in order to synchronise it with the pestilence in Rome.
<P>The facts about the particular places in Cyprus which were destroyed by this earthquake and the seismic sea-wave which is supposed to have accompanied this earthquake, are very obscure. 
<P>If we trust the allusion in the Sibyllina Oracula, the places in Cyprus which suffered most should have been Salamis, Paphos and Cition, but it is questionable whether these places suffered from the 76 AD earthquake or from a later shock. It seams probable, from the slight indications,
mostly inferences from statements at a later date, that,
with the possible exception of Cition, Salamis and Paphos should lave been damaged to some extent by the 76 AD earthquake. The chroniclers were evidently not quite certain of the particular places in Cyprus which were damaged by this earthquake.
<P>The Sibyllina Oracula prophesies also a destructive seismic seawave. This prophesy constitutes the sole authority upon which Oberhummer and after him many authors have based their arguments for the 76 AD seismic sea-wave in Cyprus. But we find no mention of such an event in the narrations of early chroniclers, and we feel that should an event such as a catastrophic seismic sea-wave had in fact accompanied this earthquake, it should have been most certainly included by these chroniclers in their description of the seismic events of 76 AD.
<P>Whether, in this instance, the Sibyllina Oracula can be trusted as a source of authentic historical information, and if so, whether the seismic sea-wave in Cyprus which is mentioned in the text refers to the earthquake of 76 AD, all yet remains to be investigated. No other data worthy of any confidence has come to our attention. 
<P>(above from reference #23)
<P>It is probably that the earthquake [76 AD] was associated with a seismic sea wave at Salamis and Paphos but it is not certain whether this was the result of this or of another earthquake. (reference #9116)"

After the third time, the water came from the sea with a great noise, about 15 sazhens high, covering - all of the low places round about and also the lower hills. It carried away many native dwellings, baggage, food, and skin boats and caused no little loss to the Russians who were there at the time, who, leaving all of their baggage in the yurts, had to flee to high ground and there seek to save themselves. Between the rivers Viliuchik and the Avacha cove a small new cove was made. The place where the cove was formed was a meadow with kliukva and shiksha berries and two huts stood there in which the natives had put food. At the time of the great water the huts were carried away with the ground and two native women and a man who were in the huts were drowned. <P>An excerpt from a journal provide grounds for supposing that in 1737 strong tsunamis also lashed the Komandorsky Islands: <P>The greatest changes on the island [Bering] may have resulted from earthquakes and high sea tides. Indubitable signs of powerful inundations were driftwood, bones of whales, and whole skeletons of sea cows which had been carried high up on the shores or far into ravines toward the center of the island. By the age of the drift logs I could conclude quite confidently that in the inundation of 1738 [an obvious error; 1737 is meant] on the coasts of Kamchatka and the Kurile Islands, the waters also lashed Bering Island to a height greater than 30 sazhene [64 m]<P>(above from reference #413) <P>Reference #11787 states the following regarding Georg W. Steller account included in reference #413: The abbreviation f or ft instead of the word foot (feet), which was interpreted by the clerks as fathom. Finally, in the Russian translation of the fair copy, fathom (1.83 m) was replaced by Russian fathom, or sazhen (2.13 m), a unit of length formerly used in Russia, and the already six times overestimated tsunami height (30 fathoms = 54.9 m) was increased by another nine meters. Reality the height of the 1737 tsunami runup on Bering Island was hardly more than 34 m; only in individual narrow valleys of the rivers flowing into small and shallow bays could it have reached 810 m."

There was an earthquake (17 S 72 W, mag 8.5) and tsunami in Peru and in the northern part of Chile. The tsunami flooded the coastline for a distance of 1200 km. Arica suffered most of all. According to a report of the governor of Arica, the ocean receded a distance of two musket shots further than its normal low water point, and then, while the tremors were still occurring, raged with such force that it covered the islet of Alacran, situated opposite the high part of the city. A barrack-type building (wooden or adobe) was carried away with this first wave. The second shock, which occurred 15 minutes after the first ebb, caused the water to recede again, only to reappear in rising form, sweeping the town and carrying away warehouses, stores, and a large church, and advancing another 100 m inland and destroying all houses. Subsequently, the water receded to the point where the anchors of all ships were exposed... Three persons drowned in Arica itself, and more than twenty along the coast... In Ilo, the water rose to a point where it advanced almost 2 km inland along a valley uprooting 100-year old fig trees. Eleven indians were drowned...

from the tsunami, dated December 5, 1604 and signed by the
Corregidor of Arica. The port of Arica, formerly located near the center of the bay, was completely destroyed by the tsunami and the town was rebuilt at its present location, close to the famous Rock or Morro of Arica. Arequipa, in the Peruvian interior at a distance of about 260 km, was almost completely destroyed; only the convent of San Francisco remained standing. People were thrown to the ground by the earthquake; the losses were estimated at more than a million gold pesos. The tsunami is not accurately described, but it is known that at least three successive waves flooded the coast line along an extension of 300 ""leguas"", or 1200 km. The Peruvian port of Pisco more than 800 km northwest of Arica, was damaged by the tsunami according to one report. Damage from the tsunami extended across the Pacific Ocean. The effects of this great earthquake, as far as they are known, were similar to those of the great Arica earthquake of August 13, 1868. The

Tsunami in Acre, and possibly nearby coast.
This earthquake and tsunami have been widely referred to in the published literature. Ambraseys (ref#15) and Ambraseys (ref#3845) relate this tsunami to the coasts of Lebanon and Israel. Amiran (ref#10419) suggest that the tsunami occurred on Jan 4, 1034, in Jaffa, and that the port of Akko fell dry for an hour. Soloviev (ref#2130) mention that tidal waves were observed in Gaza and Ashkelon, and that the seaport of Akko became dry for a long time and then it was half destroyed by a wave. Guidoboni (ref#10420) interpret that the tsunami effect is confined to Acre, but it is reasonable to suppose that the tsunami affected more of the coast. Ambraseys (ref#9116) constrains the tsunami to Acre and suggests that it did not cause damage or loss of life inland. Shalem (ref#10422), however, suspects this description might have been duplicated from the 1068 event. Following the detailed analysis of Ambraseys (ref#3845) and Guidoboni (ref#10420), the tsunami can be constrained to the northern and central coasts of Israel only.<P>Regarding the cause of the tsunami, Amiran (ref#10419) mention a swarm of earthquakes during the winter of 1033/4, probably in the Jordan Valley, including the strongest shock on 1033 12 10 and another one on 1034 01 04. Ambraseys (ref#10421) and Ambraseys (ref#3845) also locate the earthquake in the Jordan Valley but date it on 1033 12 05. A detailed analysis by Guidoboni (ref#10420) suggests that the earthquake occurred on 1033 12 05, although Arabic sources give the date of 1033 12 05 as 1034 01 04. In their opinion, Perrey (ref#10418) dated this event to 1032 03 06, which is then further confused with 1033 03 06, the date of the earthquake that occurred in Constantinople. <P>(above from ref #10416)<P>1033, Dec 5. A damaging earthquake occurred in Palestine... In Acre the sea flowed out several kilometres before flowing back as a wave an hour later.

A strong destructive earthquake occurred in the vast region from Syria in the northeast to Egypt in the southwest. Half of the city of Nablus and 1/3 of the city of Ramallah were destroyed. In Jerusalem, walls were destroyed, the temple was badly damaged, other buildings suffered damage. In Gaza the mosque and the lighthouse were damaged, heavy damage was caused in Ashkelon. After one or several earthquakes the sea retreated from the shore and returned swiftly. Tidal waves were observed in Gaza and in Ashkelon. The seaport of Akko became dry for a long time, then it was half destroyed by a wave. (ref #2130)<P>1035, April or May. From the study of the available information on these individual earthquakes, it appears that there are at least four major distinct earthquakes that occurred between 1033 and 1035 AD. A third very strong earthquake occurred in April or early May 1035 AD and damaged the northern provinces of Syria. It appears that the April or May 1035 AD earthquake was responsible for the seismic sea-wave. During this earthquake, extensive faulting and probably some crustal deformation occurred in the Saida-Sur area. (ref #26)"

The tsunami flooded the town (then situated in the site of Penco), and washed away the wreckage of buildings and domestic utensils. Seven minutes later the ocean returned with great force ""the waves crowded one on another,"" and the water level exceeded its usual limits; the water burst into the town with a speed exceeding that of a galloping horse, completely inundating the town. The water advanced quickly along the river, rising and inundating the adjacent areas and flooding even houses on higher ground. Boats and canoes were hurled into the church of San Francisco, located 400-500 m from shore. Subsequently, the water receded, again quite rapidly, carrying with it walls, some of which were still intact, and household items. Where the town had stood there was nothing but an impassable heap of ruins. And in the Cantarranos quarter, only the piles of the houses were left, all the rest having been washed away. Then the water receded again, just as on the previous occasion, but it rose and inundated the area two more times, the third flooding being the most severe. <P>The next morning it was established that the water level had varied considerably; in some areas the water had risen more than 3.5 m (4 varas), in others less. <B>Twenty-five to thirty old persons and invalids (17 persons, according to other accounts) were drowned</B> in the waves of the tsunami - the only victims of the earthquake. <P>The vessel ""St. Anthony and Family,"" loaded with goods and passengers, lay at anchor in the port of Concepcion. The seaquake was very severe and it was feared the vessel might be destroyed, but it survived. With the first strong ebb, the anchor chain broke, and the ship itself was grounded, listing heavily. The returning tide hit the vessel, causing it to list the other way. Then the vessel found itself floating. Subsequently, the sea rose 17 m (9 1/2 fathoms) and the ship was thus refloated. There were three strong tides and ebbs, and each time the vessel became grounded. <P>After this destructive flood - the fourth and most severe in the history of the city - Concepcion was rebuilt farther  from the shore, and its old location was eventually used to build the new town of Penco. The tsunami was also recorded in Valparaiso. <P>The waves hit the island of Juan Fernandez, washed away a settlement and sank a vessel anchored in the port. <B>The governor of the island, his family along with 35 other persons perished</B>. <P>The tsunami reached threatening proportions in Callao; but no one died<P>There are some reports to the effect that the bottom of Concepcion Bay had risen 7 m (24 feet) during the earthquake; the resulting shoal consisted of hard sandstone rather than sand.<P>Naturalists who later visited the area of Concepcion, found, in areas of considerable elevation, many mollusc shells which were packed with river sand; such shells normally occur in the littoral zone.<P>The tsunami reached the southeastern coast of the island of Honshu, flooding the houses on Otsuki on the Djika peninsula and in Kesennuma to above the floors, but there were no deaths.

geochemistry, archaeology, in combination with fragmentary allusions in annals and legends written considerably later.<P>...Application of the methods of chemical analysis of isotopes has led to the conclusion that the first enormous eruption occurred earlier than 25,000 years ago, the second not earlier than 5,000 years ago. More accurately, the eruption has been dated at (1410 <U>+</u> 100) B.C. using the Carbon - 14 isotope inside the fragment of an ancient tree found under the ash layer on the present day Island of Thira. An estimation of the age of this sample, performed later, by the same method resulted in the earlier date of the eruption and of the ashfall: between 1700 and 1620 B.C., most likely, in 1640 - 1620 B.C.
<P>...More reliable evidence that the tsunami generated by the eruption of Santorini did reach the shores of the Near East, actually retaining its destructive force, was obtained during the geological exploration carried out in the region of the Syrian city of Ugarit, which used to be the capital of the ancient North - Phoenician state. A library of clay boards filled up with cuneiform was
excavated. Scientists deciphered one of the poems with an account of how the harbour and half of the city of Ugarit were washed out by a strong wave approximately in 1380 B.C. It is quite possible that precisely this date should be
considered the most probable date for the paroxysmal eruption of Santorini and the tsunami that followed it.

In 338 (that is, 416), a thunderous roar was heard from the bowels of mount Batuwara (also called Pulosari, an extinct volcano in the Banten region, the closes to the Sunda strait). This roar was answered by an identical roar from the bowewls of Mount Kapi, which is situated west of the modern [region?] of Banten. An enormous blinding flames, which reached the heavens, exploded from Kapi Mountain. The whole world shook. Thunder pealed out, a storm burst, and it began to rain. However, the eruption of flame from Mount Kapi not only did not diminish with the rain, but even increased. Mount Kapi exploded into pieces with a terrific noise and descended into the depths of the earth. 
<P>A sea wave arose and inundated the land. The locality from Batuwara Mountain east to Gede Mountain (Kamula) and west to Radjabasa Mountain [the most southern volcano on Sumatra Island, situated in the vicinty of Lampung] was inundated by the sea. <b>The residents of the northern part of Sunda district, as far as Mount Radjabasa were drowned</b> and washed away together with all their belongings. 
<P>After the water receded, Mount Kapi and its locality were left on the sea bottom, while Java Island split into two parts. Thus the islands of Sumatra and Java were separated.

<P>262 AD. South Coasts of Asia Minor (iv?). From Trebellius Pollio we learn that in the consulship of Liciniusb Gallionus desasterous earthquakes occurred in Asia Minor and in Lybia. Many houses collapsed causing a large number of deaths, and in many places large cracks opened into the ground, and clefts were formed. The sea overwhelmed many cities (Gallieni, lib. v, Q 2-6). Trebellius says also that these earthquakes occurred while a great pestilence raged in the east. The pestilence, which is also mentioned by Eusebius (Eccles. History, lib. vii, Q 22) together with the fact that at that time Gallienus was consul, fixes the time of this event in 262 AD. It does not seem certain that these earthquakes happened at the same time in Asia Minor and in Lybia. Nor that the inundations alluded to by Pollio took place in Asia Minor. We were unable to find a more detailed information to these events. (reference #23)

The date of occurrence is uncertain: some authors date the event in 542 B.C., others in 543 B.C. or in 544/545. According to Giudoboni, the description of anomalous sea behavior in Thrace is dated 544/545 B.C. In area of Odessos (today Varna), Dionisopolis (today Balchik) and Afrodision the sea went out of its coasts as far as 4000 steps (about 5.8 km) in the Thrace coast. Many people drowned. (ref. #4139) <P>542 (possibly 543, Sept. 6), winter. Region of the Sea of Marmara. An earthquake. Cyzicus was destroyed. In some places, the shore of Thrace was flooded for 3-4 km including Odessus, (i=4). The sea returned to its normal state after many people were killed and much damage done. Waves were observed in Dionysioupolis, Aphrodesion, in the Gulf of Edremit, in Asia Minor where many towns were flooded. There exists no reliable information on the preceding earthquake, but values of its parameters are available: 40.3 N, 27.8 E, M = 6.8. (ref #2130) <P>542 Winter. Sea of Marmara. Thracian Coasts and Gulf of Edremit. From Cedrinos we learn that in the reign of Justinianus the sea flooded the coasts of Thrace and that the cities of Odessa (Varna), Dionysioupolis, Aphrodesion and other towns in the gulf of Adramyttium were inundated. The sea in many places advanced four miles inland and after drowning many people and causing heavy damage to the land retired to its habitual places... Neither Cedrinos nor Glycas imply in any way that the inundation of the Thracian coasts was the result of an earthquake. We notice, however, that Theophanes and Cedrinos mention in this period an earthquake which devastated Kyzicos (Banderma) and damaged Constantinople. This earthquake can be easily placed in the beginning of Sept 542 AD. This inundation of Thracian and Aegean coasts shows quite clearly the characteristics of a seismic sea-wave. It does not seem improbable that the cause of this wave was in fact the earthquake at Kyzicos (Banderma). When these two events happen to be so closely spaced together. From the narrations of the writers in the Corpus Scriptorum Historiae Byzantinae on earthquake events of the period, one feels inclined to go even further and suggest the earthquake at Constantinople of 542, that of Kyzikos and the seismic sea-wave that followed belong, if not to the same earthquake, but to the activation of the Marmara region. (ref #24) <P>544. Black Sea. A destructive sea wave in the Black Sea flooded the coast of Thrace, inundating Odessus (now Varna), Dionysopolis (now Balchik) and Aphrodisium by advancing 4 miles inland, drowning many people before retiring. This event is mentioned by Theophanes, who places it in a.M. 6037 (Sept 544 to Aug 545), or in the 18th year of Justinian (Cedr. CS 657), which commenced in April 544. He does not mention, however, whether this event was associated with an earthquake. (ref #9116) <P> Tsunami observed in the Kapidag Peninsula, Erdek, Bandirma. (ref #11164) <P> <blockquote><i>Ref #11868:</i></blockquote>  <P>A large earthquake occurring offshore of the Bulgarian coast of the Black Sea, very likely produced a strong tsunami that inundated in three coastal zones, namely Odessus, today Varna; Dionysopolis, today Balchik; Aphrodisium, situated in the Thracian Peninsula at the Xeros (today Saros) Bay, Northeast Aegean Sea. It is reported that sea advanced on Thrace by 4 mi and covered the three territories. Many drowned in the waters. However, no further details available. It is puzzling how a single tsunami event was capable to inundate coastal zones in Bulgarian Black Sea and the same time Thracian coasts facing the North Aegean Sea. This tsunami event is a good example, which indicates several uncertainties that often arise from historical documentation of tsunamis."

<P>426 BC Summer (possibly 425), 38.75 N, 22.75 E, earthquake magnitude 7.1, intensity XI, tsunami intensity v. Aegean Sea, eastern Greece. Island of Euboea, Gulf of Maliacus. Evidence provided by Thucidides indicates that a series of earthquakes occurred in the regions of Attica, Boeotia, Euboea in the autumn of 427 B.C. ... Several shocks in the summer and autumn of 426 B.C. occurred in the strait separating the Euboea Island from the continent. <P>According to eyewitness Demetrios Kallatianos, a significant part of the Lichades Island and the Cape Cenaeon sank under water. The shore near Orobies also sank and the coastal line shifted deep into dry land. The base of one of the peninsulas opposite the continental shore sank, and the Island of Atalanti appeared (Talantonissi). <P>After one of the earthquakes, the sea in Orobies retreated from the coastal line, but later on, coming back in the form of huge ""swelling"", it partly flooded the settlement and this was repeated many times. According to Strabo, the waves flooded the shore three times, penetrating the continental coast of Greece 3-4 miles inland. Gullies in the vicinity of Tarfi, Thronium, Thermoplyles and Daphus were flooded, and many settlements were destroyed. A similar flood took place on the Atalanti Island: here, waves caught up triremes and dragged them along the shore for more than 2 miles; another trireme was torn away from a moorage and smashed against the walls. The sea also retreated from the coast in Peparithos and Skopelos, too, but no flood accompanied this process. The wave was observed in Opus near Kiparissi. On the eastern shore of Euboea Island no waves were observed. Judging from descriptions, a tectonic collapse occurred in the strait between the Euboea Island and the continent, resulting in great seiches. One must agree with Antonopoulos that possible local landslides of friable material were not the main cause of variations in the water level in the strait.

Explosion of volcano Santorini causing caldera collapse. Catastrophic tsunami generated.

Devastation from the tsunami occurred along northern Crete, western Cyprus, and the eastern Mediterranean as far as the Syrian coasts. Estimates of height of the tsunami vary from 40 to 90 m.

<br>According to excavated cuneiform texts on clay boards, a tsunami of intensity vi [?] occurred in Syria. <B>These writings most likely referred to the events of 1380 B.C. (1380<u>+</u> 100) B.C., and to the period between 1700 B.C. and 1380 B.C.</B> in accordance with other sources.
<P>Aegean Sea, Island of Thira, Hellenic Arc, Island of Crete. The catastrophic eruption of the volcano of Santorini accompanied by earthquakes and a powerful tsunami. As a result of natural disasters, the potent Minoan
Kingdom of the Late Bronze age ceased to exist on the islands of the Aegean Sea. No eyewitness account of these events has reached modern times. The reconstruction of events is based on the data of marine and ground geology,
geochemistry, archaeology, in combination with fragmentary allusions in annals and legends written considerably later.... <P>...Application of the methods of chemical analysis of isotopes has led to the conclusion that the first enormous eruption occurred earlier than 25,000 years ago, the second not earlier than 5,000 years ago. More accurately, the eruption has been dated at (1410 <U>+</u> 100) B.C. using the Carbon - 14 isotope inside the fragment of an ancient tree found under the ash layer on the present day Island of Thira. An estimation of the age of this sample, performed later, by the same method resulted in the earlier date of the eruption and of the ashfall: between 1700 and 1620 B.C., most likely, in 1640 - 1620 B.C.
<P>...More reliable evidence that the tsunami generated by the eruption of Santorini did reach the shores of the Near East, actually retaining its destructive force, was obtained during the geological exploration carried out in the region of the Syrian city of Ugarit, which used to be the capital of the ancient North - Phoenician state. A library of clay boards filled up with cuneiform was
excavated. Scientists deciphered one of the poems with an account of how the harbour and half of the city of Ugarit were washed out by a strong wave approximately in <B>1380 B.C. It is quite possible that precisely this date should be
considered the most probable date</B> for the paroxysmal eruption of Santorini and the tsunami that followed it.

Many houses, churches and towers collapsed with <B>little or no loss of life</B>, due to the fact that the people, warned by the foreshock, had taken refuge in the open.

<P>Following the earthquake the sea in the Gulf of Corinth near Vostiza receded a great distance from the shore and, on returning with great violence, flooded the town three times. The third wave was so large that it reached the upper part of the town, beyond the Platanos, flooding the hill slopes to the south that overlook the town, washing away houses, stores and the customs house, and stripping trees of their leaves. Destruction was instantaneous and all sailing ships, boats and two large coasting vessels in the port at the time of the earthquake were totally destroyed.

<P>Regarding the 869 Tohoku-oki (Jogan) earthquake, a Japanese history book, Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku (A chronicle of Japan), records On the 26th of the 5th month of the Japanese calendar (July 9, 869), a large earthquake occurred in the province of Mutsu (divided since into the five provinces of Iwaki, Iwashiro, Rikuzen, Rikutyu and Mutsu). The sky was illuminated like day-time. A little later, people, panic-stricken by the violent trembling, were lying on the ground; some were buried under fallen houses and others inside wide-opened ground fissures, while horses and cows desperately ran about and trampled each other. A number of castles, towers, and other tall structures collapsed. Then roarings like thunder were heard towards the sea. The sea soon rushed into the villages and towns, over-whelming a few hundred miles of land along the coast. There was scarcely any time for escape, though there were boats and the high ground just before them. In this way about 1000 people were killed. Hundreds of hamlets and villages were left in ruins. (Imamura, 1934). This earthquake is suggested to be one of the predecessors of the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake (e.g., Sawai et al., 2015). The magnitude and source region of the 869 earthquake were re-evaluated (e.g., Sugawara et al., 2012; Namegaya and Satake, 2014) using the insights obtained from the 2011 tsunami.

Like Lima, Callao consisted mostly of single-storey houses on a low-terrace, whose height was no greater than 3 m (9-10 feet) above the high water mark. The town was enclosed by a fortress wall, whose base was sometimes washed by the strong ocean tides. Normally, the water level at Callao rises 1.4 m (4-5 feet). Up to 5000 persons lived in the town. Callao was damaged by the earthquake to the same degree as Lima. Approximately one half hour after the earthquake, the ocean ""swelled"", rose approximately 10 m, smashed the city wall and inundated the city. When the water receded the majority of houses and other buildings were dislodged from their foundations and washed away. A sizeable portion of the city wall, including the gate, had been carried away by the water. Almost the entire population of the town perished in this disaster. Since the water advanced 4 km inland, it overtook even those who had tried to flee to Lima. Only about 200 persons managed to save themselves by clasping onto wooden objects which were being tossed about between the shore area and the island of San Lorenzo, a distance of more than 8 km away.

<P>1674, Feb 17, between 19:30 and 20:00 [local time]. There was a very strong earthquake, which affected all Ambon Island and adjacent islands and left human victims... <P>Immediately after the earthquake, a tsunami occurred on the entire coast of Ambon Island. The northwestern shore of Hitu peninsula suffered most of all, especially the region of Ceyt, between Lima (Negrilima) and Hila. Here the water rose 80-100 m that is, to the top of the coastal hills. The trees, including those in the clove plantations, which covered the calcareous coastal slopes at Mamala, Ela, Sinalo, Kaitetto, Ceyt, Loboleu, almost as far as Lima, were uprooted. Only the higher-lying plantations at Nausihola, Wakal and Hitulama escaped destruction.
<P>Everything was so ""jumbled"" onshore that it was unrecognizable. In the region of Loboleu, a coastal strip with the width of a musket shot subsided. The shore became very precipitous between Cety and Hila and at Hila itself, part of the coast also collapsed into the water, carrying with it the settlements of Nukali, Ehalaa, and Wawani.  In all, 2,243 people died on Ambon island as a result of the tsunami.
<P>According to eyewitness accounts, the water rose up like a mountain. First it inundated Loboleu, and then it split into three streams. One of them spread along the coast to the west to Lima and Urien, another to the east to Hila, and the third went out to sea, in the direction to Cape Ryst on Ceram Island, carrying with it trees, houses, domestic livestock and people. The movements of the water were accompanied by a very loud nose. The moving water was black, very dirty and evil smelling; its surface phosphoresced.
<P>According to the eyewitnesses, the surface of the sea in the strait between Ceram and Ambon Islands, was calm, and it was agitated and made a deafening noise only off shore, to the distance of a musket shot. People in a boat not far from shore did not notice anything unusual in the state of the sea; the oscillations in its surface were just as weak and small as usual. On the coast, all the proas and other boats were smashed or carried away by the water. Many fish were tossed up on land.

<P>Lovholt et al.

Therefore, the primary source of the tsunami and earthquake remains open to question.
<P>More significantly, we have shown that the only way to explain the extreme run-up only on the northern shore of Ambon, and in particular the very narrow lateral extent along the coast over which it occurred, is by attributing the tsunami generation to a submarine landslide."

One of the eyewitnesses who described the earthquake was thrown from his bed, and the wall of the home partly collapsed. At dawn, it was found that the sea had retreated far from shore and that all the ships riding in the roadstead had sat on the bottom. Soon thereafter the sea returned, surging in with great force and washing away everything in its path. The water advanced so far inland that a bridge was inundated. At Bengkulu, the shocks lasted at least until April 8, the postdate on the letter.

Both the statement that the waves began at the first onset of the shaking and the short period of the waves suggest a local
landslide source. 
<P>This event was not recorded by the tide gages at San Diego, San Pedro, or North Beach, but apparently was observed in Hilo. Cox and Morgan (1977, p. 14) cite a letter dated January 30 written by Titus Coan, a missionary at Hilo. Coan mentioned unusual water level oscillations
occurring not long before. Cox and Morgan estimate that the wave was 4 to 8 feet-large enough to have been noteworthy and yet not to have caused damage. Given the lack of a
recording, the event would have to have been quite small. Validity 3.

Coan dated January 30, 1854, which says ""The recently renewed oscillations in the sea level off the coast of Hawaii Island made us think that an underwater eruption had taken place at the foot of the island or somewhere among the mountain chains or individual volcanoes hidden under the waters of the Pacific"" (Reference #415).
<P>1854, January 16, soon after 9:00 local time. There was an earthquake lasting more than a minute in Pavlovskaya Harbor (Saint Paul Harbor) on Kodiak Island. Then up to six perceptible oscillations were felt for an hour and weak ones were felt all day. The earthquake recurred twice on the night of the 17th, and weak oscillations were felt until January 21.

<P>1848, October 16, 02:10 [local time, Oct 15, 14:10 UTC]. There are several accounts of sea level disturbances that have been interpreted as possible tsunami on three days during the 1848 earthquakes: October 16, i.e. the day of the mainshock; October 18 and October 19. According to Collinson (1848) ""eight hours after the first shock [which occurred on October 16 at 0140 local solar time], it being high water but neap tides, the tide rose in Wellington one foot [0.3 m] above ordinary spring tides"" i.e. the rise occurred on October 16 at about 9.40 am local solar time. Ironsides (1891) account indicating that the vagaries of the inflow and receding of the waters ... were remarkable, although included in the transcriptions is given little credence, as there is clear confusion in his full account of the earthquakes with the effects and uplift, and almost certainly the tsunami, that occurred in the 1855 earthquake. Hence, Collinson (1848) is the only contemporary account of a tsunami on the day of the mainshock, despite there being newspapers and other journal writers that recorded day-to-day events. The date in Collinsons account is almost certainly incorrect and should be October 18.
<P>The lack of a tsunami being recorded at any time during the sequence of earthquakes, including the mainshock, is consistent with accounts written some years after the 1848. It is not clear whether these include locations other than Wellington. However, it is unlikely that a large tsunami and/or its effects, had they occurred near the source in Marlborough or along Wellingtons southern coast, were not observed despite the fact that few people lived there. Further, the lack of large or even moderate tsunami near the source is consistent with the lack of an observable tsunami within Wellington Harbour. On the other hand, it cannot be entirely ruled out that a small tsunami occurred. If a tsunami had been generated by the mainshock, it would have arrived in the Wellington City area an hour or so after the earthquake, on an ebbing tide about 2 hours after low tide. The occurrence of low tide could have masked the occurrence of a small tsunami. However, as many people lived on the beach in Lambton Harbour, and as they were disturbed by strong earthquake shaking, damage and aftershocks, they would surely have observed and commented upon any unusual repetitive ebbs and flows of the sea, had they been obvious, that is, exceeding 20-30 centimetres.

<P>1848, October 16, 01:40 [local time]. On October 16 at 1:40 [local time] the first of a series of shocks occurred in the region of Cook Strait. Eight hours after the earthquake, during a high water slack period, the water level in Wellington had risen 0.3 m higher than the mark of the highest flood tide. This effect, however, could have been caused not only by the earthquake but also by a strong southeast wind blowing on the 15th and 16th. Unusual changes in the sea level were noted also in Nelson and Wanganui."

<P>1859, October 11. In the port of Caldera, the ocean was agitated again and ships riding at anchor experienced entirely the same effect as the shocks produced on land. [Apparently, the date is mistaken, and this report concerns the earthquake of October 5, 1859, since other more accurate catalogues (Perrey, 1867; Montessus de Ballore, 1911) note that on October 11 only two very brief shocks, not doing any damage, were felt at Copiapo.]

In Wellington, the ship Pandora was anchored in 11 m of water. According to the captain, the shocks that were generated during the earthquake, which lasted over a minute, felt as if the ship was hitting rough bottom. Disembarking with his mate onto the beach, the captain became aware of a rapid succession of ebbs and flows. The waves were observed for at least 50 minutes, as they rolled over the shore of South Island. A ""terrible"" tidal wave rushed onto the shore. (reference #415) <P>The 1855 January 23 0932 UT 2111 Local time MW8.2-8.4 Wairarapa earthquake generated New Zealands largest historical locally-generated tsunami. The tsunami most affected the Cook Strait region, where the Wairarapa Fault and subsidiary faults (Wharekauhau Thrust and small play fault) ruptured beneath Cook Strait causing significant uplift (up to 6.4 m) of a large region west of the fault on the northern side of the strait and a small amount of subsidence on the southern side. The effects of the tsunami were observed at least as far north as Waikawa Beach, where fish were deposited above high water mark, and as far south as the Clarence River mouth and possibly Kaikoura, although evidence for the latter is equivocal. A bore in the Avon River attributed by De Lange & Healy (1986) to tsunami and the great sea wave in Otago harbour (Davie, 1870) were almost certainly seismically induced seiches, not tsunami. Seiches, often confused with tsunami on the coast, were observed in coastal rivers and estuaries at Wairoa (Hawkes Bay), Motupipi in Golden Bay, Kaiapoi and at Lyttelton, as well as in many inland water bodies. The greatest known height (10-11 m) reached by the tsunami was at Te Kopi in Palliser Bay, where a shed on a cliff 9 m above the sea was swept away. Here also, on the night of the earthquake and tsunami, a sailor who had experienced a tsunami in South America, persuaded a family to leave the shore. Nearby, at Whangaimoana, a tool that had been on the shore at the time of the earthquake was found many years later in a location 10 m above high water mark. High waves were also observed along the coast south of Wellington and along the Wairau Bar on the southern shore of Cook Strait, probably reaching 6-7 m near Rarangi. In Lyall Bay the tsunami swept about 2-2.5 km inland, inundating what is now the suburb of Miramar. The sea sweeping in from Lyall Bay (est. height above sea level at time, 4-5 m) reportedly met the water sweeping in from Evans Bay, on the Wellington Harbour side of Rongotai Isthmus (est. height above sea level at time 3-4 m). Within Wellington Harbour, water levels varied considerably. At Petone and along the road to the Hutt Valley, fish were deposited (the tide was high at the time of the earthquake) but the water levels do not seem to have reached much more than a metre or so above normal. However, the shops along the beach front at Lambton Quay (now on reclaimed land 200 m from the shore) were inundated with waves about 1.4-2.4 m above sea level at the time immediately after or during the earthquake. Barnett et al. (1991) (Grapes & Downes (1997)) separated the source of the tsunami within the harbour into three different components: the horizontal movement, causing an immediate slosh; differential vertical movement across the harbour; and the much greater deformation in Cook Strait and extending across the whole region west of the fault. For a local source tsunami, the duration seems to have been quite long, observations consistently indicating that in Wellington harbour and in Cook Strait water levels oscillated for 8-12 hours. It was also said that the tides were irregular for a week (see entries for January 24-31, January 24 and February 3). (reference #5324)"

The source of the earthquake apparently lay off Acapulco and San Marcos.
<P>A tsunami arose. At Acapulco, the sea retreated to the middle of the bay, exposing the reefs. Alternate quiet flood and ebb tides were observed with some pauses in the movement of water on reaching the highest and lowest levels. Two hours later, the flood tide was so large, that the water reached the doors of the church situated in the highest part of the city square. The square was flooded. The ocean advanced inland like a wall and with great speed, sweeping away everything in its path. Then, in a strong ebb tide, stronger than in 1787 [?], the greater part of the bottom of the bay was laid bare. After this, the sea level began gradually to return to its normal state. After the tsunami, the breakwater was totally covered with sand for 1 1/2-2 m (5-6 feet), while the beach had expanded by 17 m (20 vara).
<P>There is also an account by the master of Acapulco port. ""Yesterday at 14:00, a strong earthquake occurred in the port. It lasted 5 minutes; it recurred in the next quarter of an hour, and was followed by other shocks, not so prolonged. All this terrified and depressed the
inhabitants .... After the horrors of the earthquake, there began movements of the sea in the form of an unusual flood and ebb tide, the first (along the horizontal) from 40 to 50 m (from 60 to 60 vara), and the second approximately
from 15 to 20 m (from 20 t o 25 vara). One of the two ships, which was taking on provisions in the harbor, was forced to retreat out to the bay for safety"".

<P>The area in which the earthquake of April 11 had originated, gave rise to a tsunami which was recorded over a distance of 800 km, including in Huasco. At first the ocean receded a little, but it quickly swept back over the land, penetrating in places up to 600 m beyond the high water line. <B>Caldera sustained considerable damage</B>. After the tsunami, the inhabitants went to the shore to dig for copper ingots which had been washed away by the waves.
<P>At Concepcion, the rising waves advanced up the River Bio-Bio; on the 12th at 02:00 the anchorlines of the schooner ""La Fortuna"" were broken by the ebb and flow currents and the schooner ended up being grounded on rocks.
<P>On the western shore of the island of Hawaii, nine oscillations of the sea level were noted, starting with an ebb and occurring at intervals of 10-11 minutes. The water level rose up to 2 m, but there were no casualties. In Honolulu the sea level rose and fell 13 times within a few hours.

Excerpt from journal of the ship's commander: On Jan 8, 1780, on the 18th island, called Urup, there were great quakings of the earth, every day, both by day and by night. ... On June 18 [June 18 Julian date is equal to June 29 in Gregorian calendar], in the night before morning, almost at dawn, there was a great and terrible quaking of the earth, which continued for a quarter of an hour  they looked at the sea: in the distance fires flashed like lightning.  And a little while after the quake there was suddenly a loud rumbling. That was the running out to sea of a strange, swift tide. Stones which had been in the sea by the shore were left dry. And with the same noise first the water ran in from the sea in a great wave, and the whole shore, except for the bluff, was covered, and then the water, swiftly and with the same noise, returned to the sea. And the sea fell even more than before... And the water came swiftly from the sea like a wall, rising higher than all of the small shore crags by 5 or 6 sazhens, and it suddenly poured into the cove with as strong and sharp an onslaught as on the bluffs of the river. Our yurts and huts and everything that was there, to the last post, were torn from the ground and carried away up the creek into the gulch. And all of the people and their gear were carried along the gulch. Even stones which had been at the mouth of the creek were rolled out and carried away. There was an iron cannon on the bluff -- it was found about 50 sazhens away. And the gulches near the sea were filled with water to the top. The ship, the brigantine Sviataia Natalica, was carried with its anchor straight along the creek over the tundra into the gulch and was set down on dry ground near a rivulet. From the sea to the ship was 190 sazhens. And the breadth of the low ground across the gulch at the place where the ship was would be about 100 sazhen. Of the working people, they found <B>4 dead after the water went down</B>. And all that day until evening the water went back and forth, rising and falling, only less from hour to hour. And afterwards the people gathered all of the baggage that had been carried away and dried it. And after several days they went in skin boats to visit their people who had been elsewhere. They learned that the eastern and southern sides of the island had been inundated by the flood. At one place <B>eight of the natives were drowned</B>, they said. On the north side of the island there was no flood and the water did not rise at all. It is not known whether there was a rising of the water beyond where we were, on the 19th (Iturup) and 20th (Kumashir) islands. On June 28 Shabalin lent people to Kamchatka in one skin boat with the report, and I had to follow them on July 1 through the islands from the 18th. From the time of the flood up until our departure there were frequent quakes every day. On the 17th (Chirpoi), 16th (Simushir), and 15th (Ketoi) islands, also, there were frequent tremors while we were there. The sea flood which had risen on the 18th island had also come up on these islands but less.

Flood and ebb tides were observed at least eight times. The flooding was markedly greater at some places than at others, and the impression was created that this was due to the propagation of waves in a southwestern direction, at an angle of 45 degrees to the coast.

<P>1856, March 2, between 19:00 and 20:00 [local time]. Validity definite. On Sangihe Is, after a sudden ""unbearable"" roar, the Awu Volcano began to erupt. Incandescent lava rushed down the slopes of the mountain with irresistible force, destroying everything in its path. Where the lava reached the shore, the sea water began to boil. Strong hot springs gushed up and the abundant surging boiling water destroyed and carried away everything that the fire had spared. 
<P>The sea surged onto the shore cliffs as during an underwater earthquake, and with a terrifying noise, it flooded the coast and ""snatched its victims from the fire.""
<P>An hour later, thunderous blows were heard, shaking the earth. A black column of ash and stones was ejected from the peak of the mountain. The column rose to the ""heavens"" and fell in a rain of fire on the slopes of the volcano, which were lit up by the red hot lava. Total darkness
fell, in which one could not make out the closest objects; it was interrupted from time to time by outbreaks of light. Large bombs fell to the earth. The settlements and fields not destroyed by the lava were buried under a layer of ash and rocks. The flows rushed down from the mountain, and, encountering obstacles, spread out in lakes, which then became a new source of destruction.<P>All this took several hours. By midnight, all had quieted down, although the eruption began with new force the next noon. The ashfall continued all day and was so intensive that no light could penetrate, and almost total darkness set in.<P>A hurricane southeastern wind blew since the beginning of the eruption, and the ashes were carried as far as Mindanao Island. Later the wind blew from the north.<P>On March 17, there was a new eruption, in which fields and trees on the coast at Tabukan were destroyed. After this, the volcano quieted down, except that steam continuously rose from the numerous cracks and fractures. However, the lava flows were still so hot that one could not approach them. According to residents, the top of the volcano did not change noticeably in appearance.<P>At the main village of the island, Tahuna, several people were injured and homes were destroyed during the fall of ash and stones. Obstacles in the form of hills made the lava flow deviate from the village and turn to the sea in another place.<P>Along the flat slope between Tahuna and Kandhar, seven large lava flows descended to the sea, devastating this agricultural region. One of the flows passed through Kalongan village; only a few burned posts were left. Between Kalongan and Kandhar, a large area of the coast subsided below sea level. The mountain side had previously sloped gently to the very water line; after the eruption, it broke off as a steep wall about 60 m (200 feet) high.<P>The settlement of Kandhar, protected by this ""rib,"" suffered little: it was affected only by the fall of ashes and stones and the streams of hot water. In addition, before the eruption, the residents, fearing pirates, had hidden with their belongings in the thickets above the settlement, and did not suffer from the flooding.<P>The devastation was even greater on the coast from Kandhar to the northern tip of the island. Two tongues of lava thrust far into the sea to previous bottom marks of several metres (fathoms).<P><B>The number of victims was considerable: at Tahuna 722, at Kandhar 22, at Tabukan 2,039; total 2,806. For the most part, the people died in the gardens where they sought relief  from the heat. Those who attempted to run, were overtaken by flows of lava and water, perished under collapsing trees, were suffocated or were burned in the ashfall and the fires. At Kalongan and Tariang, the residents who took refuge in their houses died in the debris. Finally, those who took to the sea shore ""fell prey to vicious waves"".</B>"

At Perrey's request, Osten-Saken reviewed the records of the Russian-American Company for the years 1840-1860 and sent him all of the information that he found there concerning seismic and volcanic phenomena in the territories of the company.
<P>P.N. Doroshin compiled a list of earthquakes in the same territories for the years 1840-1866 on the basis of similar material and also of his own notes which he made during his service with the Company.
<P>Below we present the text of Doroshin with small additions from the text of Osten-Saken.
<P>""On April 13, 1843, at Urup at sunrise there were two strong shocks three seconds apart. They were preceded by a roar like distant thunder. The shocks came from the southwest and continued for seven seconds. After about three [?] minutes, with a fresh west wind, the water began to flow with terrible swiftness out of the bay [Aleutka] where the settlement was located, and the bottom of the bay was left completely dry. Then with the same speed the bay again filled with water and even inundated the shore to a considerable height. For several days the water was in constant movement; now it would come in, now go down, and each change was accompanied by a strong rip (agitation from the meeting of the currents).""
<P>This earthquake, apparently was one of the catastrophic ones, as it was observed on all of the southern Kurile Island and on the east coast of Hokkaido. In the Nemuro and Kushiro areas the earthquake attained destructive force. Thus, it is reported that in the town of Akkeshi, situated between these two points, one of the tombs was moved 1.5 m.; in the temple grounds fissures 10-15 cm. wide were formed. The earthquake was followed by destructive tsunamis; in the Kushiro area the height of the waves was 4.5 m. Especially affected by the tsunamis were the villages located on the shores of Akkeshi Bay which has the shape of a bent funnel, penetrating deeply into the land. In the village of Shinryu, at the bend of the funnel, all of the houses were washed away by the waves and <B>45 persons perished</B>.
<P>According to Japanese estimates, the intensity (magnitude) of the earthquake was M = 8.25 to 8.5. Taking into the account the considerable extent of the center of the quake and the area of occurrence of the tsunami, this estimates seems likely to be correct.

The small amount of damage was attributed to the prevalence of timber construction. Montessus de Ballore claims that no ""maremoto"" was generated; yet the reports of tsunami damage on Samoa, Hawaii, and the coast of Japan must be connected with this event. Three successive fluctuations of the sea were observed in Ancud, but no wave was generated along the east coast of the island.

<P>1835, February 20, (approximately 11:30). There was a destructive earthquake (37N 73W, mag 8.25) and tsunami in the center part of Chile with its source near Concepcion. <P>When the earthquake began, the whole surface of water in Concepcion (Talcahuano) Bay churned. The water darkened and gave off the very unpleasant odor of hydrogen sulphide. At approximately one half hour after the earthquake, the water in the bay receded to the point where all rocks and reefs were laid bare. Then it flooded once more and again receded so that vessels anchored in the bay appeared to be on dry land. Then a huge wave, from the island of Quiriquina, passed along the west shore of the bay, shearing off houses, uprooting trees, sweeping and carrying away everything that was movable... After several minutes a second huge wave appeared, approaching with an even more terrifying noise and violence than the first. Despite the enormity of the wave, its passage was less destructive since there was little left to destroy... After several minutes of tense expectancy, the inhabitants, who had taken refuge on higher ground, saw a third wave rolling between the island of Quiriquina and the mainland.. This wave appeared even larger than the two previous ones (by other accounts, it was somewhat smaller); it roared, dashing against obstacles and carrying along everything in its path. Then suddenly, as if repulsed by the foothills, the water receded, carrying away such a huge quantity of articles snatched from houses (partitions, furniture, etc.), that after the ebb, the whole ocean appeared to be covered with this wreckage. This disaster prompted the inhabitants to begin noticing approaching waves when they were still 5-7 km away from shore. <P>
Waves were reported along the coast from Valparaiso to the island of Chiloe, a distance of more than 1000 km.

Santa Maria Island rose 2.5-3 m in the middle, 3 m in the north, 2.5 m in the south. Mocha Island rose 0.5 m. Then the elevated block slowly subsided and after 2 months the rise of the shores at Talchuano was reduced to 0.5 m. This subsidence apparently came to a stop simultaneously with the cessation of the aftershocks.

On Neira Island, there were strong vertical shocks, which rapidly became undulating oscillations of growing force, which lasted 5 minutes.<P>At Bandaneria, 1/4 hour after the earthquake, the sea rose and the frightened residents took to the hills. The bay alternately dried up quickly, then filled with water. A ship riding at anchor at a depth of 9 m sat on the bottom twice. According to the account of the captain of the brig ""Hai"", before the earthquake, the ship was riding at anchor at a depth of 11 m between the islands of Neira and Lonthor; the length of the anchor chain was 65 m. The seaquake was very strong. Then at 8:10, the sea which had risen quickly surged off to the southeast with unbelievable speed. During the strongest ebb, the depth of water fell to 7 m. After this, at still greater speed than it retreated, the water rose and ran 65 proas around which a few minutes prior had been left on dried bottom. Then the water once again surged back with terrible speed, destroying and carrying away everything. Twenty minutes after, the water rose again; the depth of the water was 14.5 m. This time the wave was as much stronger and more fearsome as it was higher. It inundated the breakwater and the embankment, where most of the crews of the proas had taken refuge, and carried them off. <B>Sixty people died</B>.

These changes were ascribed to the earthquake and tsunami of Nov 26, 1852. The surface of these islands was still soft and had a yellow golden color. Three new small islands were discovered betwen the islands of Tayandu (Trando) an Kaimer (Kauer). These islands were composed of fragments of corals and yellow sand. As was related, one of them was later washed away, while the other two were covered over with shrubs.

Validity 4 with some uncertainty on the date. A massive wave in Lituya Bay cleared trees to a height of 120 meters.  The occurrence of the wave is evidenced by a well-marked zone in the forest on either shore of the bay, the demarcation line of which separates two tree populations of differing ages.  Growth ring dating of the younger, lower trees indicated that a wave had cleared the forest between the growing season of August 1853 and May 1854. It is believed that the wave was generated by a rockslide on the south shore of the bay.  The report of many drowned at Dry Bay between 1850 and 1860 is probably associated with this tsunami. Native histories variously suggest from 8-10 war canoes with 8 men each were lost, to the loss of an entire village, as possible results of this event. It is tempting to combine these events with the poorly dated account of the 1845 glacier collapse in Disenchantment Bay and the 1847 Sitka earthquake. However, the tree-ring date for the Lituya Bay seems to fix that event to near the 1853-1854 period but an under-counting is possible. Therefore, these are considered as separate events [1845-1847 and 1853-1854]; the Lituya Bay event does not seem to have been associated with an earthquake. This is the earliest of five landslide tsunamis reported for Lituya Bay by Miller (1960). (Ref #239)
<P>The following is from reference #415:
<P>1853/1854. During studies in Lituya Bay, mainly in 1948 and in 1952-1953, clear traces of the past effects of a strong wave were found. Namely, along the northern and in places along the southern shore of the Bay, an age-old forest grew, beginning only at a certain well-marked boundary. Below this boundary and as far as the zone of flood tides, there grew only a young forest. Judging by the number of rings on trunk sections, it was established that the wave arose between the middle of August 1853 and the beginning of May 1854.
<P>The maximal known height of this boundary is 120 m (395 feet) above mean sea level; the maximal distance from the water line is 750 m (2500 feet); the known area of the zone of destruction of forest is 3 1/2 km squared. Judging from the remaining traces of erosion, the destructive force of the wave of 1853/1854 was little less than that of the waves of 1958. 
<P>According to Indian legend, in the 60's of the XIX century, at the exit from Lituya Bay, eight canoes with people were lost in a sudden flood. The cause of the waves is unknown."

Talking about earthquakes, the natives informed me, that on a former occasion, before my arrival on the coast in 1871, a village named Aralu (situated on the coast between the rivers, Kabeneu and Koli) had been completely swept away by the waves after an earthquake. All the huts and the coconut trees surrounding them, were broken down and carried away by the tidal waves, and the inhabitants, men, women and children were drowned (it occurred during the night). A few men belonging to the village and who happened to be away at the time on a visit to some neighbouring village would not attempt to rebuild their huts on the old place, but went to live at Gumbu now Yeimas, also a coastal village but which had escaped destruction being built further inland. The destruction of Aralu was remembered by not very old people and it took place I suppose about the year 1856. The natives on the Maclay-Coast complained about the sickness in the villages on the coast which happened soon after the destruction of Aralu. The sickness amongst them, I believe, was the result of decomposition of animal and vegetable matter left behind on shore after the inundation produced by the high tidal wave, as has been observed, on some islands of the Pacific."

<P>1863, June 3,1863, 19:20 [local time]. There was a catastrophic earthquake in Manila and adjacent provinces. It was comparable in force only with the earthquake of 1645. The water in Manila Bay retreated from the capital to Cavite, and then returned, moving in the opposite direction. The captains of two English frigates, riding in the bay, related that at about 19:30, a wave surged onto the ships from the southeast. It hit the ships and rolled over the decks, completely submerging them. The frigates shook and trembled as if they were being hit on the bottom. The water around churned and was covered with foam. A boat [or one of the frigates?] supposedly touched bottom at a depth of 18 m (10 fathoms). It was also said that the <B>steamship ""Esperanza"" disappeared with all its crew.</B>
The sources note that after the earthquake the coast was constantly visited by storms, which almost paralyzed navigation. The sea inflicted heavy losses.

<P>On April 10 (mistakenly 4), 1815 there was an explosion of the Tambora Volcano on Sumbawa Island which was thought to be extinct. It was the strongest explosion in historical times in Indonesia. It was accompanied by considerable oscillations in sea level. The eruption began on April 1. At 22:00 [local time] at Bajuwangi (Java Island), a cannonade boomed out like peals of distant thunder. It was repeated from time to time, and this continued until 9:00 on the 2nd. On the morning of the 3rd, a light fall of ashes began; on the 5th, explosions began to be heard at 1/4 hour intervals.
<P>The eruption reached its peak on the evening of the 10th, when a colossal pillar of smoke rose above the volcano and the entire mountain seemed to eject flame. Soon the volcano and all that occurred there were hidden in a dense cloud of smoke. 
<P>The sound of a shot was so loud that it was heard for an enormous distance: from Bengkulu and Banka Island in the west to Ternate Island in the east. At Surabaja, the air wave uprooted trees, destroyed the walls of homes, and bowled over people and animals. The tremors were felt more or less strongly at Banjuwangi, Sumenep, Surakarta, Rembang, apparently on the southeast of Kalimantan Island, at Makassar and on Flores Island.
<P><B>Scorching hot slag and ashes covered all of Sumbawa Island and a sizeable water area. Buildings collapsed under this load. The previously picturesque island was turned into a desolate desert. Of 12,000 residents, only 26 survived.</B> On neighboring Lombok Island, the depth of the layer of ashes was 0.5 m. A similar layer of ashes was floating at sea west of Sumbawa Island on the 12th. On Java Island, the ashfall was so dense that complete darkness set in. The ashes fell on Java at a distance of 550 km from the volcano; it also fell on Sulawesi Island at Ambon. From this one can conclude that the ash was ejected to a very great height, as otherwise it would have been carried by the trade winds only to the west.
<P>On the 10th, with still weather, the sea off the coast of Sumbawa Island suddenly rose to a height of 0.5 to 3.5 m. Large waves burst into the estuaries of the rivers and immediately surged back. Here and there homes and trees were washed away. At Bima, the water submerged the floors of homes by 0.3 m. All the proas and boats were torn from their anchors and tossed onshore. The coast at the Tambora volcano subsided so that water 5-6 m deep appeared in place of the land.
<P>Short-period (duration no more than 3 minutes) oscillations in level were noted on Sulawesi and Java Islands. At Sumenep, on the 11th at 19:00 during an ebb tide, a flood tide of water from the bay made the river rise 1-1.5 m; then the level fell for 4 minutes.
<P>The explosions of the volcano, which were accompanied by strong tremors, lasted several more days. Eruption finally came to an end only on July 15.

Before the catastrophe, there were 120 homes on this island in the villages and temporary settlements, and about 1000 people lived there. Ninety-six homes were destroyed by the earthquake and tsunami; about 3/4 of the population perished.

[The tsunami was generated by an earthquake on the 24th or the 25th.] One of the eyewitnesses, who was on board a ship riding in the bay, gave the following account of the effects of the main earthquake and the tsunami in Umatac Bay: ""The first, main earthquake began with an exceptional trembling of the water, which was then transmitted to the land. The displacements of the ground were so large that all stone and brick buildings suffered to some extent, and many completely collapsed. One of my boats were taking on a supply of water in the mouth of the river. It was caught by the flood tide, and almost tossed on to the trees. Barrels and other objects were carried 1/2 km (1/4 mile) or more from the shore to open sea. When the wave rolled back, hundreds of fishes were left on the dried bottom. The shore near the river dropped about 3 1/2 m (12 feet). The wave entrained the ship with such force, that it could not hold to its anchors. The water ran up onto the island in an east-west direction. A mild northeasterly wind was blowing.""
In the Inarajan region (southeast coast), a woman was caught up by the wave near the Talofofo River, and never reappeared. People arriving from Satawal Island (Caroline Islands) related that this island was flooded by a wave.

<P>There is a detailed description of these events at Bulukumba. The earthquake began with weak, but gradually intensifying tremors. The house of the fort commander rocked in every direction. The guns on the bastion jumped from their carriages. The earthquake lasted 4-5 minutes, when, it seemed a cannon shot pealed out from the west. A sloop sent to reconnoiter had not had time to return with the report that were no ships on the horizon, when a water wall 20-25 m high arrived with a whistling and at the same time thunderous roar and inundated everything. Surging 300-400 m inland, the water destroyed the barracks of the fort and the villages of Nipanipa and Terangterang. Four to five hundred people drowned, including three Europeans. Ships off the coast were tossed in to the rice fields. The oscillations in level recurred several times, and the water retreated several kilometers from shore during the ebbs. 
<P>A strong earthquake lasting 2 minutes, accompanied by a loud rumble, was felt at Bima. It was followed by a tsunami which tossed ships riding at anchor in the harbor far inland; some ships were even tossed over rooftops by the waves.

<P>1771, April 24, about 8:00 local time. Validity 3. Following the shock on the Ryukyu Islands, a tsunami was observed with varying intensity at different places. On the Kume and Kerama Islands, 350 km northeast of the source of the earthquake, the tsunami was weak. On Yonaguni Island, about 180 km southwest of the source, and also on Hateruma and Iriomote Islands, the shores of which are protected
by coral reefs, there was no great destruction.  
<P>The islands of Ishigaki, Taketomi, Kuroshima, Aragusuku, Miyako, Irabu, Tarama, and Mizuna situated closest to the source (60-80 km), suffered greatly and there were many victims there.
<P>The damage done by the waves on Ishigaki and Miyako Islands was about the same. However, the quantitative data on the height of the waves on these islands are contradictory. In the Japanese literature, the shaku (30.3 cm) and the jo (3.03 m) are usually used as a unit of measure of length. In all probability, the shaku and the jo were confused in a number of cases describing the tsunami. Miyako 10.5 m wave; Ishigaki 11.4 m wave. 
<P>The rise of water on Ishigaki Island can also be judged by the fact that a large stone (750 t) was transported to a height of 15 m. The three waves registered on both islands were observed for 2 hours; therefore one can assume that the period of the waves was about 30-40 minutes.
<P>On Miyako and adjacent islands, 1,054 homes were washed away. A total of 2,548 people died, The villages situated on the Pacific coast of the islands of Miyako and Irabu suffered very heavily. In fact, at Miyakoku, Nissato, Uruka, and Tomosato homes, stone dikes and trees were washed away, and fields were scoured. On Tarama and Mizuna Islands, closest to the source, absolutely everything was washed away and the villages were leveled.
<P>The tsunami approached Ishigaki Island and adjacent islands from the southeast, and the villages Maezato, Ohame, Miyara, Shiraho, Tozato, Ibaruma and Yasura, on the eastern coast, were completely washed away. More than half of the homes were washed away at the villages of Ishigaki, Shinkawa, Toyashiro, and Hirae, on the south side of the
islands.
<P>There was similar destruction on Kuroshlma and Aragusuku

1792 (mistakenly 1793), May 1. In the winter of 1791-1792, there was a strong eruption of Unzen volcano (Nagasaki Prefecture, Kyushu Island), which lasted four months. It did great damage to the vicinity of the volcano and was accompanied by frequent underground shocks, as a result of which homes collapsed here and there. Some people were killed. The side of the mountain collapsed at the end of the eruption, and this caused a destructive tsunami.

Swallowed by the waves, Goryou frantically yelled at the villagers and urged them to evacuate to Hirohachiman Shrine. The tsunami traveled up the river washing away houses and agricultural fields, and then returned to the sea at frightening speed. Left around them was a hopeless sight. Adults and children alike were milling around calling for and trying to find their families. Goryou noticed there must be people wandering around in the dark, unsure of where to evacuate to. Suddenly he thought, ""I know, Ill set fire to the rice sheaves up on the hill, even if it is a bit wasteful,"" and he set fire to the rice sheaves. Drawn by the fire the villagers who had failed to escape then started arriving on the hill one after another. ""Oh, I was saved because of the fire.""

<P>1782, May 22. Validity 2. An earthquake which affected all of Taiwan Island and caused great destruction, was accompanied by tsunami waves, which ran onto the coast of the island in an east-west direction. Almost the entire island was flooded for a distance of more than 120 km (30 leagues). The tremors and tsunami waves lasted 8 hours. The three main cities of the island and 20 villages were first destroyed by the earthquake and then by the tsunami. Retreating, the water left buildings, at best, as piles of debris. Not a single living soul was left. More than 40,000 residents died.  Many ships were smashed or sunk. In place of the capes, jutting into the sea, which were washed out, fresh scarps and gulfs filled with water were formed.

The storm was reported to have induced some damage, but the crop yield of the whole province (including Fujian & Taiwan) was reported to be not affected. Thus, a great disaster occurring in the region during that period was highly unlikely. The casualty claimed (40,000 lives) was approximately 5% of the whole contemporary population of Taiwan, which could have seriously damaged the stability and economy of the society.

After a period of extraordinary activity of the volcano of Stromboli which started in Feb, its powerful explosion occurred with a noise of unprecedented intensity and with the discharge of enormous puffs of black smoke that enveloped the entire island for a short time. Anyone trying to move was knocked down. The explosion was accompanied by water being blown up from the sea and flooding the coast, everything around was overturned, and all the ships were carried approximately 300m up to vineyards adjacent to the coast. The tsunami waves were generated (evidently, owing to a sudden increase of the atmospheric pressure). ""The displacement of water, like during a weak tsunami, was observed on the Island of Ustica. First, a whirlpool appeared in the sea in the Piccolo Lagoon of the Island of Capri, i.e. in the part of the island facing the Island of Stromboli, and reefs usually covered with water were uncovered for 1 m, and then, 6-7 s later, powerful waves gushed over the normal water line. Oscillations of the sea level of a very low amplitude (0.5 cm) with a period of about 11 min were recorded by the tide gauge stalled at the lighthouse [Faro] near Messina after l8h and lasted 90 min; they resumed half an hour later and lasted 30 min more. The tide gauge in Messina recorded usual sea waves with a period of 7-8 min, but of a low amplitude - about 1 cm, 2 cm maximum - during the eruption. Oscillations of a much higher amplitude started approximately at 18h, and the amplitude reached 7.5 cm 20min later; after that, the waves caused by the eruption started to subside, but continued about 3 hours more. No signs of tsunami in the records of the tide gauges in the towns of Palermo, Catania, Cagliari (Sardinia Is), Naples, on the Island of Ischia, in the town of Civitavecchia were revealed.

The volcano Matavanu on the island of Savaii (Samoan Islands) was active between August 4, 1905, and November. Huge streams of lava up to one cubic km in volume emerged, one of which moved in a northeasterly direction and reached the ocean shore, a distance 12 km from the crater on December 6, 1905. Fields and villages situated in the path of the lava stream were destroyed. From time to time the lava tongues fell into the water and gave rise to small tsunami-type waves (including at the end of 1906 and in 1907). One of the phases of the eruption was observed by the missionary, John Farlong. According to his account, after some periods marked by earth tremors, on August 4, 1908, two yawning fissures appeared from which clouds of steam, illuminated by flames and eruptive material, shot up with explosive force. The streams of lava moved at a rate of 900 m (1/2 mile) in a 24 hour period, and at the points where the lava fell into the sea huge columns of steam rose, several times in the same area. They were 450 m (500 yards) in length and inundated the land for a distance of 90-110 m (100-120 yards). According to observers, the appearance of the waves coincided with increasing volcanic activity. (reference #415)

One family was on the Hoopuloa wharf to get a canoe to see the flow better. Suddenly, the sea receded, exposing the bay floor. The waters soon returned as a 4.3-m wave washing the man, his wife, and one son off their feet. One son tried in vain to save the family auto and was swept into a wharf shed where he held onto some beams. The man was washed about 100 m to sea, but managed to get back. His wife was carried about 400 m to sea, but was rescued by two Hawaiians who swam to a still floating canoe to reach her. The man estimated that there were 10 waves. An 18.000-liter water tank was destroyed. At Keauhou the wave height was about 2.4 m and about 0.9 m at Kailua.

<P>1919, Septetmber-October. On September 26, the Mauna Loa volcano, which had been dormant since June 1916, revived. A thick flow of lava issued from this lower crater. Less than 24 hours later, it filled up all irregularities of the relief, drove a road through the forest and reached the sea side approximately 28 km (15 miles) from the crater. For 10 days, the flow poured into the water, sometimes generating local tidal waves. On October 2nd, one family was washed into the water and was almost lost. Then the eruption began to subside, although volcanic activity was still noticeable on October 23 (Reference #415)."

The natives told me that during my absence they had experienced on the coast and the mountains several earthquakes, on which occasions some natives were killed by the falling of cocoanut trees in the villages, which in falling destroyed the huts. The villages on the coast suffered more on account of unusually big waves which followed soon after the earthquake, breaking down the cocoanut trees and sweeping away a few huts nearest to the beach. In revisiting the coast villages, I found many not unimportant changes: stretches of destroyed forest by tidal waves after the earthquake; alteration in the direction of some small streams, the old mouths of which had been closed by bars of sand left behind by waves.

It is reported that the village of Makushin on Unalaska Island was destroyed by an earthquake and tsunami on this date, but this event cannot be substantiated and does not appear in contemporary reports.

During the shaking and trembling connected with these phenomena the fish seem to have left the shore and the inhabitants were for a season obliged to go to adjacent island to lay in their winter supply...Makushin is a very poor village of about fifty inhabitants, with a chapel, but no store...Their fishing grounds were so disturbed in 1878, by the volcanic eruption on Oomnak Island, that they were compelled to move their old village to the present site.""

It was barely felt on the Duke of York Islands (30 km east of Rabaul). The earthquake was accompanied by two tsunami waves, which washed out a large section of the coast of Matupi Island (according to other sources, the earthquake occurred two days before the tsunami). 
<P>Soon after the earthquake, clouds of steam could be seen rising out of the water along the line joining the Raluan Volcano and the Tawurwur (Ghaie) Volcano. An hour later, the old crater of the Ghaie Volcano exploded with ""terrible force."" Flames and enormous masses of smoke and ashes were ejected. There were apparently <B>no lava flows</B>. A thick layer of ash and pumice covered the coast and Saint George's Channel. At Ghaie, a new cone was formed. At the site of the underwater eruption, a cone-shaped, but rather flat elevation 20 m high formed out of loose material. This later became Raluan (Baluan) Island. The eruption of the Raluan Volcano lasted three days, during which time total darkness reigned; fishes and turtles died. The eruption of the Ghaie Volcano lasted three weeks. Due to the prevailing northwest winds, the ejecta settled mainly in the sea, and on land only the regions immediately adjoining the volcanoes suffered. Blanche Bay and Saint George's Channel were plugged up with islands of floating pumice for a month.

This catastrophic event caused a maximum uplift of 47 feet on the western side of Disenchantment Bay, and was felt over an area estimated at least 216,300 square miles on land.  A number of separate tsunamis were triggered by both tectonic uplift in Yakutat Bay and submarine and subaerial landslides from Valdez to Lituya Bay.  Glacier regimen alteration also occurred in the area.
<P>The following is from reference #415:
<br>The tectonic movements and, to some extent, the collapse of large masses of ice and rocks into the water, were the cause of the appearance of a tsunami and seiches...The tongue of the Hubbard glacier broke off on a stretch of 9 km (5 miles) and slipped 1 km (half a mile) into the bay. Water poured out of the small lake and rushed downwards.</br>
<br>At Yakutat, according to eyewitnesses, the water became very agitated after the earthquake, and at least until nightfall the level rose and fell 2 1/2-3 m (8-10 feet) every 8-10 minutes.</br>
<br>According to one account, as soon as the earthquake had ended, flood tides rolled in from the sea. There were at least three large waves. The water level rose from the ebb tide mark, which occurred at the time of the earthquake, to 0.3 m (1 foot) above the high tide mark, that is, it rose 4 1/2 m (15 feet). Eddies formed in the bay, in which trees, driftwood and all kinds of rubbish circled so rapidly that it was difficult to follow individual objects. The water foamed up and was covered with whitecaps on the whole expanse. Reaching the chute of the sawmill, the whirlpool tore it off and carried it away in an instant.</br>
<br>According to another eyewitness, after the earthquake the water in the bay began to retreat stormily and passed the line of the lowest low tides. Soon afterwards, the water returned in a strong current and covered the shore over a considerable stretch. Everything around the Indian huts was flooded and washed away, and the huts themselves were very nearly washed away.</br>"

<P>1871, February 21. On Camiguin Island there was a

Many wooden homes were destroyed and massive stone walls collapsed at Mambajao and Catarman; many avalanches occurred in the mountains. Many more shocks were registered almost daily until April 30. Four of these were strong, and were felt almost the same as the main earthquake (Maso, 1910 a).
<P>On April 30, the Hibokhibok Volcano (Camiguin Island), which had been considered extinct, exploded and a new crater was formed at its foot. Maso (1911 b), describes the events as follows.
<P>On April 30, at 7:00, a new volcano exploded with a terrifying roar on the north-northeast tip of the island. A column of steam, stones and ash rose into the air; the ash fell for a distance of up to 200 km from the volcano. Everything was destroyed in a radius of 2-3 km from the new crater. There were no victims, since the residents of the nearest settlement, Catarman, frightened by the earthquakes, had left their homes before the eruption. The underground shocks stopped almost completely for several days after the eruption.
<P>Fuchs (1872) describes the eruption somewhat differently.
<P>On April 30 (or May 1), the plain at Catarman settlement began to subside gradually, so that the roofs of the homes were soon at ground level. While many residents were observing this phenomenon, suddenly, at 17:00, a terrible roar pealed out, cracks appeared in the ground, and an eruption began from the small crater which had newly appeared in place of the village. A large cloud of smoke rose into the air. Flows of lava and water issued. The explosions, like shots from a large cannon, continued uninterrupted for several hours. Then a brief pause ensued, after which the explosions began again and new subsidences occurred, and lava again flowed from the crater, flooding the huts in its path and falling with a terrible hiss into the sea. A dense cloud of ash hung over the island. Shafts of flame from the volcano burst through the dark ash. The eruption lasted a long time.

October 6, 1883. This eruption of Saint Augustine Volcano, producing a reported ashfall of up to 5 inches, was accompanied by a series of tsunamis.  The first wave may have been produced by the effect of the air wave from the eruption on the water, while the tsunami was the result of a debris avalanche from the collapse of the north face of the peak. An eyewitness account of the volcanic tsunami produced by the eruption was recorded in the daily log of the Alaska Commercial Company trading post at English Bay(Alaska Commercial Company, 1883): ""At this morning at 8:15 o'dock, 4 tidal waves flowed with a westerly current, one following the other at the rate of 30 miles p. hour into the shore, the sea rising 20 feet aboye the usual level."" Augustine Island, a nearly circular volcanic island that has had six significant eruptions in historical times, is surrounded by underwater deposits similar to that produced by this slide; tsunamis were probably generated repeatedly by this volcano in prehistorical times.  It is possible that there may have been Aleut casualties during this event (a search for five or six Aleut hunters camped on Augustine Island just prior to the eruption yielded nothing) but the descriptions are unclear; the <B>death designation here is conjectural</B>.
<P>The tsunami was apparently generated by a debris avalanche from the collapse of the north face of the peak.

The article is based on details provided to the governor by one of the island inhabitants and contains the following statements:
"". . . the tide ran out a great distance, and on its return, swept away the villages built on the beaches of the different islands of the archipelago and on the mainland. The outflow and inflow occurred four times a day, the greatest damage being done by the third wave. The villages of Rio Coco, Isla Paloma, Napacandi, on the islands of the same name, were swept away, and more than forty persons were drowned. At Playon Grande, every house was washed down,
but only two persons were drowned. Playon Chico, which adjoins it, also suffered. All the produce stored at Rio Mono was swept away, but no lives were lost. The chief loss of produce, however, has taken place at Aguili Candi island
. . . Sixteen persons lost their lives there, and several thousand dollars worth of imported goods were swept into the sea. The villages of Rio Banana and Mosquito have also been flooded, the people left homeless, and their goods destroyed. ""Although the sea was observed to be relatively calm at Colon, the Canal Company tidal gauge located offshore registered a distinct tsunami with a maximum height of 62 cm (Bulletin du Canal Interoceanique, 1882; Nelson, 1889). At Miguel de la Borda, the tide rose and flooded beach houses (Star and Herald, 1882). Because subsidence was extensive in the area, however, the tsunami effects at Miguel de la Borda cannot be accurately estimated. The submarine telegraph cable between Col6n and Jamaica broke during the earthquake (Star and Herald, 1882; De Montessus de Ballore, 1888; Nelson, 1889). (reference #1575)"

The height of the wave is not mentioned, but allegedly about 100 persons were drowned at San Diego and 85 at Barra del Paz. Some property damage was caused on the coast of Acajutla and Cara Sucia. Some writers associate this event with a spurious earthquake on 1902 February 26 (Cruz & Wyss 1983, reference #82) or with the earthquake of 1903 April 19. However, there is evidence that this <I><B>wave was not triggered by an earthquake, but rather that it was the result of a combination of a high tide and abnormal meteorological conditions</I></B> (Anderson 1908, reference #7975; List 1903, reference #8016). Most of the earthquakes associated with seismic sea waves are located just off the coast or a few tens of km inland at distances from the shore comparable with their source dimensions. It is not clear whether these waves were due to tectonic movements of the seabed; the evidence for some off the southeast coast of Costa Rica points to submarine slumping or to their being seiches set up in Fonseca, Nicoya and Chiriqui bays.

<P>1902, Feb 26. 13.5 N 89.5 W, validity likely, tsunami magnitude 2.  On February 26, the residents of the Pacific coast border regions of Guatemala and El Salvador heard a loud rumble, like cannon shots, which appeared to come from under the bottom of the sea. A strong earthquake then occurred. Soon the residents saw the water retreating, exposing the sea bottom for a considerable distance. After this, a black wall arose at sea: this was a large wave, whose might increased as it approached the shore. The wave surged onshore with terrifying force. The residents did not have time to run to safety and they perished. The tsunami was observed on a 120-km stretch of coast which included Acajutla, Ecuador. <B>One hundred people died and about the same number were injured</B> at Barra de Santiago settlement. About <B>85 people died</B> at the village of Barra del Pas. Homes and trees were washed out to sea, and the clothes were ripped from people caught by the water.

Bits of masonry were scattered around for a distance of up to 100 m, so that only the remaining paved courtyard indicated the previous site of the church. The earth was furrowed with ditches, carved out by the retreating water. The trees were uprooted and strewn helter-skelter with debris of homes and various utensils.

<P>1896, June 15, 19:33 (local time). A strong earthquake in Sanriku, Honshu Island, was felt over an enormous area and generated a catastrophic tsunami. According to official accounts, 10,617 buildings were washed away, 27,122 people died, and 9,247 people were injured... The tsunami was observed at least from the south of Hokkaido Island to the Bonin Islands, and also on the Hawaiian Islands and in North America. The Sanriku coast on a stretch of more than 400 km from Kinkazan Island in the south to Cape Shiriya in the north, suffered most of all.
<P>At most places on the Sanriku coast, the tsunami began with a noticeable ebb tide. The exact time of the beginning of the ebb tide in the pleistoseismic area is unknown. According to the data of the hydrometeorological station at Miyako and the accounts of some eyewitnesses, the ebb tide began at nightfall, 15-30 minutes after the earthquake. The first tidal wave arrived immediately after 20:00. Consequently, the time difference between the beginning of the ebb tide and the arrival of the tidal wave was 30 minutes. The magnitude of the ebb tide naturally depended on the depth of the sea: in shallows, the water retreated a great distance, while at deep places, it retreated a small distance. Thus the water retreated 350 m at Horiuchi, 350-550 m at Ryoisi and Ooya, 500 m at Minatohama and 35 m at Tadaide.<P>Before the flood tide, a loud rumble like thunder or the noise of a squall could be heard from far at sea. The wave appeared simultaneously with the rumble on the coast of Kesen district, Iwate Prefecture, while it appeared soon after the rumble at other places. It is said that it was even heard in the prefectures of Akita and Yamagata.<P>It is also very difficult to establish the time of arrival of the tidal wave. The time, estimated by the hydrometeorological station at Miyako, 20:07 can be considered the most precise. According to the report of this station, the tsunami began 18 minutes after the first underground shock. A flood tide began at about 20:00, and a wave of great height, accompanied by a loud rumble, arrived at 20:07. Then the flood tides recurred six times: at 20:15, 20:32, 20:48, 20:59, 21:16 and 21:50. The second, the largest wave, washed away many people and carried
homes out to sea.<P>The average period of oscillations on the Sanriku coast after the arrival of the tsunami was about 15 minutes. The intensity of the waves began to gradually abate after 22:00, but small oscillations in sea level were still being observed at noon of the following day. The greatest height of rise of water was registered at Yoshihama and Ryori. The second, greatest wave was 24 m high at Yoshihama and the water rose 30 m at Ryori.<P>On June 15, the residents of the prefectures on the Sanriku coast were celebrating a national holiday in the streets; there was no work that day. After the ebb tide, with which the tsunami began, some hurried away from the water, but the majority continued the festivities. Practically the entire population of the flooded zone, except for a few individuals miraculously spared, perished in the roller which fell on the Sanriku coast. In addition, the fishermen who had gone out to sea were saved; returning home in the morning, knowing nothing about the events, they saw a horrible picture: the sea was strewn with debris of homes and corpses for several km from shore and heaps of ruins or bare expanses remained in place of the previous coastal villages and cities.

<P>1883, August 27, 0259 GMT. The explosion of the Krakatau Volcano in Indonesia generated a 30-m tsunami in the Sundra Strait that destroyed numerous towns and killed about 36,000 people. The explosion was heard about 3,000 miles away. It also caused an atmospheric pressure wave that was recorded on the tide gages at remote locations including South Georgia Island, Panama, France, England, Hawaii, Alaska, and San Francisco. Due to the shadowing by continents and island groups, a direct tsunami could not have reached most of these locations. Harkrider and Press (1967) show that the direct air waves (acoustic) are the first to be recorded. Atmospheric gravity waves with phase and group velocities nearer the oceanic gravity wave velocity (sqrt(gd)) occurred and may have excited water waves (tsunamis) by transferring energy to the ocean. The longer the fetch, the more energy that would be transferred.
These waves are the most energetic and are created beyond the land mass shadow zones. The initial acoustic waves, too, may create resonances in the coastal and harbor areas as seiches. To consider these to be true tsunamis is a stretch of the definition but atmospheric gravity waves are or may be a source for tidal disturbance which resemble tsunamis.  It was recorded with an amplitude of six inches at Sausalito.

On Pitt Island, the wharf disappeared, two small boats swept up a stream, and beaches eroded of shells. Mangere Island was also affected and a large landslide occurred. There were no deaths or injuries, although one person was washed from his horse near Owenga, and deaths may have been prevented by people at Kaingaroa and Owenga hearing the roaring approach of the first wave and running inland.

The quake generated a tsunami which arrived in Gisborne at 09:20 [local time]. The largest rise in the water level was observed about 15 km north of Gisborne on the low-lying shore between Whangara and Tatapuri. Eyewitness reports agreed that the second wave was the largest, for it reached a height of 9-10 m. Houses, roads and fields were damaged, although only a short distance of the shore was flooded. it is possible that the tsunami resulted from a landslide. (reference #415)
<P>Just after 8.30am on March 26 1947 a moderate earthquake occurred off the northeast coast of the North Island, New Zealand. It was mildly felt in several places (maximum
intensity MM4) along-the east coast, including Gisborne and Tolaga Bay. Half an hour after the earthquake a tsunami hit the coast, the tsunami being observed or its effect observable over a distance of, at least 115 km. It is possible that a small wave reached the Chatham Islands, over 600 km to the southeast. Fortunately, the coast along which the tsunami reached damaging heights was sparsely populated in 1947. Its greatest reported runup height of about 10m occurred at Tatapouri Point, and along the beach north of Turihaua Point, where it demolished a small beachside house, and carried away the decking and
superstructure of a 16m span wooden bridge across the Pouawa River, depositing it about 800m upstream. Houses at Tatapouri and Mahanga were also structurally damaged, and water entered others at Makorori, Wainui Beach, and Kaiti Beach. Along the beach south of Mahanga, north and south of Young Nick's Head, at Makorori, Tatapouri and Pouawa, crops
and/or fences were damaged. At Gisborne, three large bores and a number of smaller waves surged into the harbour and up the Turanganui River and its tributaries, but the water did not overtop the wharves nor did it do any damage along the river banks. Bores were also reported in other rivers between Young Nick's Head and Tolaga Bay. Two old bridges on the old coast road at Waihau Beach were swept away. Fish were reported washed ashore at Tatapouri and in large quantities, along the beach between Mahanga and Mahia.
<P>The tsunami occurred less than half an hour before high tide (at Gisborne) and hence its effects were at near maximum. Several people observed the arrival of the first wave and none noted any effect that might suggest that the water retreated prior to the first large wave arriving. Hence the tsunami arrived with a leading elevation, or if there was a depression, it was minor.
<P>According to one observer, the retreat of the first wave reduced the impact of the second, but the second wave appeared to be larger when it formed out to sea. At Tatapouri and Turihaua Point, the first two waves were reported as about 3-4 minutes apart, the water remaining at a high level for about ten minutes after the second wave. Gisborne harbour experienced three large surges, followed by smaller surges every 8-10 minutes for about two hours.
<P>Although various accounts of the tsunami suggest arrival times ranging from 8 to 50 minutes after the earthquake, other accounts more reliably indicate arrival times at Pouawa, Gisborne and Mahia, of no less than about 25 minutes. Some accounts also record the direction
travelled by the wave. Some almost certainly represent refraction at headlands, and in bays, others are for the most part consistent with the location of the epicentre.

In the epicentral zone, it lasted about a half minute and caused numerous slides and subsidences of the loose ground. Many points of low-lying accumulative coastal relief forms: beaches at steep cliffs, spits, etc., disappeared. 
<P>The end of the spit, which cuts off Deep Bay, disappeared under water. The depth of the water to the north of the spit increased from 1.5 to 30 m. Apparently, the wave resulting from this slide reached the lighthouse situated to the east on Sisters Rock. Acoording to the lighthouse attendant, a wave 2-2.5 m high rolled onto the little island 7 minutes after the earthquake; a second wave 0.25-0.5 m high moved in at a distance of 30 m from the first; the velocity of the waves was 10 knots.
<P>A section of coast with a pier on Goose Spit which cuts off the entrance to Comox Harbor, subsided more than 0.5 m. Waves about a meter high were observed near the slide which occurred here.
<P>Some sections subsided on Rebecca Spit, which cuts off Drew Harbor on the eastern coast of Quadra Island. According to a forest worker, a moment after the earthquake, the water level oscillated between the high and low tide marks at another place on this island. The water, which had been clear, became turbid. The fish did not bite for two weeks. A large tract of agricultural lands on Reid Island dropped 6-9 m.
<P>In Alberni Bay opposite Franklin Creek, the water increased more than 30 m in depth. The underwater cable was broken and partially buried by detritus. In the words of an eyewitness, a roller 6-9 m high, arose on the surface of the water here. The roller then scattered along the axis of the bay and turned into small tidal waves, which were observed on its shores.
<P>According to Hodgson (reference #2598), who carefully examined the epicenter zone of the earthquake, there were no real tsunami waves. Only these local waves arose, which were generated by collapses and suspension currents. A distinctive feature of this earthquake was the almost total absence of recurrent shocks.
<BR>(above from reference #415)
<P>Based on dendrochronological analysis, tsunami deposits and aerial photographs Evans states: The 1946 Vancouver Island earthquake (M = 7.2) triggered a rock avalanche from the north face of Mount Colonel Foster, central Vancouver Island, British Columbia. The resultant displacement wave ran up a maximum vertical distance of 51 m on the opposite shore and the wave crest was about 29 m high when it spilled over the lip of the lake. Water displaced during the event destroyed forest in the upper reaches of the Elk River valley up to 3 km from Landslide Lake.

Then a flood tide began as a series of waves (about seven) with ""white horses,"" which chased each other and flooded the beach, sweeping away everything in their path. The waves entered through the northern entrance to the lagoon, colliding and surging onto one another at the center of the lagoon. Whirlpools and surges arose.

<P>On April 1, 1968 at 9:42 [local time] there was a strong magnitude 7.7 earthquake with a sub-latitudinal source 60 km long between Kyushu and and Shikoku Islands (32.6 N, 132.2 E, depth 40 km). 
<P>A tsunami of moderate intensity occurred. It reached the nearest coasts of the islands of Shikoku and Kyusllu approximately 20 minutes after the earthquake. On the average, the range of the oscillations in sea level on these coasts was 2-2.5 m. The greatest rise of water, 3 m
or somewhat more, was resgistered on Shikoku Island at 
Urashiri and Komame; here the water flooded across the protective dikes and caused destruction. At most points, however, the oscillations in level did not exceed the regular flood and ebb oscillations. The tsunami, on the basis of visual observations, began with a flood tide almost everywhere. The first or the second wave was the highest. As a rule, the water level rose quietly, and strong currents arose only in narrow straits. The mean period of oscillations was close to 20 minutes.
<P>The tsunami was registered clearly by the tide gauges on the southern coast of Japan. The tsunami begins with a flood tide on all the tide gauge records. However, on the records of the instruments set up on Shikoku Island, the height of the first trough is approximately twice as great as the height of the first crest. For this reason, it has been surmised that there were subsidences of the floor in the southern part of the source of the tsunami, while elevations of the floor predominated on the whole at the source. According to Hatori, the vertical displacements of the sea bottom at the source of the tsunami were about 20 cm, and the energy of the tsunami was 1.3 X 10<sup>20</sup> ergs. According to Aida, a comparatively uniform elevation of the bottom by 30-35 cm took place at the source, and the energy of the tsunami was (1.4-2.2) X 10<sup>19</sup> ergs. It is conjectured that the earthquake was a consequence of gently sloping overthrust in a west to east direction.

<P>1928, June 15, 14:13 [local time], 12.4 N, 120.9 E. There was a destructive earthquake off the southwestern tip of Mindoro Island.  The force of tremors reached 6-7 degrees (VII-VI11 Rossi-Forel) for a distance of 20 km along the coast. The main destruction occurred in the region of the spit, screening Mangarin Bay. Here ran a railway which connected Mangarin Port with a sugar factory, and stood houses of workers and fishermen. Immediately after the main shocks, the sea surged on land, partly washed out the railway, and inundated the subsided areas of the shore (Maso, 1928)."

A catastrophic earthquake (intensity=XI), preceded by a strong shock of an hour earlier, took place on the Isthmus of Corinth. The sea level rose suddenly in the port of Karistos in the south of the island of Euboea: the rise of the sea level reached 30 cm for 10 min. Then the water rolled away from the coast at a velocity of 3-4 knots and became 10 cm lower. This phenomenon was repeated several times over 22 hours, reaching its greatest intensity at 11h, when one boat could not leave the port in spite of all the efforts of the oarsmen in it, and a sailing vessel could not come into the port, slued round and dropped anchor on the roadstead. Strange drops in the sea level were observed on the same day on the Island of Skyros to the east of the Island of Euboea. The movements of the sea should apparently have been related precisely to the strong earthquake that occurred on April 22, although the time of the earthquake and the reported time of the noticed oscillations of the sea level did not coincide.

This tsunami affected about 35 miles of shore line. Validity 4. (reference #237)
<P>The Lompoc earthquake of 4 November 1927 (MS 7.0) was one of the largest offshore events in California, and the associated tsunami was recorded in Hawaii as well as on the California coast. The epicenter of this event has long been debated; one location is offshore where the ocean is about 1000-m deep, whereas another location is very near shore beneath a water depth of less than 100 m... Both the arrival times and waveforms of the recorded tsunami of the 1927 Lompoc earthquake indicate that it occurred offshore at about 34.2<SUP>o</SUP>N, 120.75<SUP>o</SUP>W, where the water depth is about 1000 m... Using the mechanism solution obtained by them, the seismic moment is estimated to be 3 X 10<SUP>26</SUP> dyne-cm, corresponding to Mw = 7.0. This value is consistent with the surface-wave magnitude, indicating that tsunami excitation is similar to that expected from surface waves. The large tsunami observed at Hilo is due to the bathymetric effects near Hilo Bay. The tsunami magnitude estimate of 7.6 made by Abe (1979) is apparently an overestimate because of this effect. (reference #3796)
<P>1927, November 4, 5:51. There was a strong earthquake with source on the edge of the shelf on the northern boundary of the Murray - fault zone. Large slides took place on the coast in the Santa Barbara district, and the movement of traffic on the railway was interrupted. Flues were damaged at Lompoc and other coastal settlements. A very strong seaquake was felt on the ""Sokonia"" 50 km (27 miles) from Arguello Point, on the ""Alaska Standard"", 25 km (15 miles) from the same cape and on other vessels.
<P>A tsunami arose, which was observed on the coast of California and was registered on the Hawaiian Islands. An employee from Surf reported that there was a wave 'approximately 1 1/2 - 2 m (6 feet) high, which began with the crest. A railway employee at Port San Luis observed a fall and rise in water level of 1 1/2 m (5 feet) followed by oscillations in level for an hour. According to the lighthouse attendant, in the same port a rise occurred, followed by a drop of 11/4 m (4 feet), without subsequent substantial oscillations. An observer at Pismo Beach compared the tsunami with large storm waves.
<P>The tsunami was registered by the tide gauges at Cape Fort (San Francisco), at San Diego and at La Jolla. On the first record, the oscillations began with a slow drop in level at 7:00, with a half period of 24 minutes. Then more rapid oscillations began with a period of about 15 minutes and a maximal amplitude of 4 cm. The sign of the first onset of the tsunami of the record at La Jolla is not definite. The oscillations had a period of 15 minutes, a maximal amplitude of 6 m and lasted about 13 hours.
<P>At Hilo (Hawaiian Islands), the tsunami began 5.1 hours (at 8:33) after ebb tide, the maximal amplitude of oscillations was 10 cm, the period 12 minutes. At Honolulu, the tide gauge registered weak oscillations with an amplitude of 2 cm and a period of 20 minutes.

<P>1937, May 28/29. Validity likely (3). There was an eruption of the Raluan and Tawurwur Volcanoes in Blanche Bay. The eruption was accompanied at different stages by oscillations of the water level in the bay.
<P>The first strong earthquake struck on May 28 at about 13:20.
<P>At about 14:00, the water in Rabaul Harbor quietly retreated 90 m from shore and then returned to its usual boundary. On Raluan Is, the water also retreated slowly, then flooded the shore to 140 m beyond the high high tideline, after which it returned to its usual mark, leaving many fish on shore. In Keravia Bay, at about 13:30, the water flooded a road, rising 1 1/2-2 m above the usual level.
<P>On May 29, at about 5:30, a new shock was felt at Rabaul.
<P>Between 8:00 and 9:00, an elevation of Kaluan Is was observed.
<P>At 11:00, it was noticed that the reef south of Matupi Is had become exposed. This had never happened before.
<P>At 13:10 the water off the west coast of Raluan Is became turbid and rough. At about the same time, the reef here dried up; the reef was hidden under water at 13:15, but it came to the surface again at 13:20. During the day, many residents collected fish on the reefs, and about 20 of these people died during the eruption.
<P>The eruption of the volcano began at 16:15. The island and the adjacent sections of bottom began to rise quickly; the little islands in the passage began to grow and merge, and soon a broad isthmus formed between the island and the mainland. Then the volcano exploded, and a black pillar of ash and steam 9 m wide and 12 m high rose into the air. The column grew with each subsequent explosion, and reached a height of 3 km. Masses of flames the size of a room or smaller flew up to a height of 1.5 km and then fell to the earth or into the water with A deafening noise. There were no lava flows. The eruption of the Tawurwur Volcano began on May 30, after 13:00. The eruption lasted until the morning of the following day; about 2,300,000 cubic m of material was ejected. It also settled to the northwest of the volcano, that is, in the region of Rabaul, where the layer of ash was several cm thick...
<P>During the first explosions of the Raluan Volcano, the underground shocks for the most part stopped. The water near Raluan Is was markedly agitated. At Rabaul, the water retreated 45 m several times, returned to the high high tide mark, and retreated again. Then the eruption was almost continuous for 3 hrs, but there were no noticeable oscillations in level.
<P>Beginning at 19:00, the eruption began to pulsate, and periods of explosions began to alternate with periods of relative calm. It was precisely, during such a period of calm and before 21:00, that is, before the lip of the new crater of the volcano had completely risen above the water, that considerable oscillations in level were observed in the harbor. Four to five minutes passed between the rise and fall of the water. The amplitude of at least three of the waves was 2-2.5 m above and below the mean water level. A schooner was run aground by the wave onto a small pier and then dragged to the depths of the bay together with the pier. Several boats ran aground, and one or two sank. Subsequently, the oscillations apparently diminished, but their range was still 1/2 m early in the morning on the 30th.

<P>According to eyewitnesses, the water level at the entrance to the harbour of Suva began to recede immediately after the seismic shocks. The wave height reached 2 m (6 feet). The dock area was devastated; a supporting wall was severely damaged as a result of blows on mooring bollards and wall embrasures, and several yachts and boats were sunk.
<P>In the opinion of Houtz, the wave resulted from currents ""descending"" from both slopes into the inlet channel and their collision in the channel. Depth surroundings carried out after the earthquake indicated that the water level along the edges of the inlet, which was flanked by steep coral reefs, had risen by 24 m (80 feet), whereas, in the channel it had dropped by 7 1/2 m (25 feet). 
<P>Two waves arrived at the island of Mbengga: one with a height of 0.3 m arrived 30 seconds after the earthquake, the other with a height of 1.2-1.5 m (4-5 feet) arrived 15 minutes after the quake.
<P>The second wave, like the tidal wave at Nakasaleka on the island of Kandavu, which was observed 12 minutes after the earthquake, and like the wave that approached Navua and Laucala 15 minutes after the earthquake, evidently was generated in an area northeast of the island of Mbengga. After the earthquake, variations in the water level of up to 100 m (300 feet) were determined by echo sounding. It is
possible that turbidity currents played a part in generating the wave, since underwater cables in the area of the epicenter were displaced, broken and buried under loose alluvium. On the basis of the damage the cables had suffered, the velocity of the bottom currents was estimated to be 10-20 knots. It should be noted that the main tsunami started on the southern coast off the island of Viti-Levu, at low tide, whereas the times of the wave passage referred to above correspond to the high tide which followed.
<P>The tsunami was observed within a radius of approximately 330 km (180 miles) from the indicated center. 
<P>The waves were observed on the island of Kandavu and west of the island of Lau.
<P>The waves had their greatest height, by various estimates, from 3 to 15 m (10-50 feet) at the reefs bordering the southern coast of Viti-Levu. The first wave was the strongest.  The approaching waves could be seen at distances of 2-4 km from the beach. Huge pieces of coral reef were thrown up onto dry land.
<P>In a number of places, coastal villages and individual houses were seriously damaged. <B>In Suva, three persons were drowned in the tsunami waves and two on the island of Kandavu. Twelve persons received serious injuries.</B> The general property damage from the tsunami amounted to approximately one tenth of that caused by the earthquake. 
<P>The tsunami was recorded by tidal gauges in Pago Pago, where it had an amplitude of 20 cm (0.7 feet); in Honolulu where the wave had an amplitude of 6 cm (0.2 feet), a period of 16 minutes, and appeared in 7.3 hours after the earthquake; in Port Allen where it had an amplitude of
approximately 10 cm; and in Hilo where it had a smaller amplitude.

<dd><P>At the time of the occurrence, some of the natives of the island of Lau were engaged in cutting copra [on Mal Island]. <B>One child and one man were drowned</B>. The natives employed by a trochus fisher were caught in the wave, but all escaped though some of them were bruised and bumped by the floating debris.
Some of these men tried to save themselves as they were being washed across the end of the island by catching at the fronds of the coconut palms. As the palms are about 30 to 40 feet in height this will give some idea of the size of the wave. If the waves had occurred at high tide the loss of life and damage to property would have been much greater...
<P>Practically all the native canoes at the affected places were either broken or damaged and there was a fairly heavy toll of pigs, fowls and dogs. <P>Except for minor instances native gardens were not affected or damaged but all Kapiaks, Betelnut, banana paw-paw and other natural products growing on areas affected by the wave have died from the effects of the salt water...
<P>Natives report that a similar occurrence happened 40 to 50 years ago and there is no doubt that the knowledge of the previous event minimized casualties, in that when the sea began to recede the majority of the natives ran into the bush...<P>To sum up the position as far as the District of Manus is concerned, is that it has had a very fortunate escape. Had the waves occurred at high tide it seems almost certain that the loss of life, and damage to property would have been very much greater, and must have been in the nature of a calamity. As it is, there has been no loss of European life and no Europeans injured. The <B>native losses are five drowned and four injured</B>. The loss to property, both native and European, cannot be called great.

The epicenter was located on the northern coast of Cross Sound near Palma Bay.  Underwater cables were broken in Juneau, Skagway, and Wrangell.  A local submarine slump off Khantaak Island in Yakutat Bay caused <B>3 deaths</B> and wrecked a boat.  Lituya Bay, the site of repeated huge local tsunamis, experienced a massive landslide which generated a surge of water reaching 525 meters in height -- 400 feet higher than the Empire State Building.  2 boats were wrecked, and <B>2 deaths</B> resulted.  30 million cubic meters of soil and loose material were washed away, along with ten square km of forest.  Shellfish colonies, a cabin, and mining equipment were also destroyed by this massive surge.  Total property damage --primarily from the three lost boats -- exceeded $100,000 (Reference #239).
<P>The earthquake caused numerous rock avalanches and slides. In Disenchantment Bay, a ""chunk"" weighing several tons broke off from a glacier descending to the water; waves 6 m high arose on the surface of the bay. On Khantaak Island, the sea waves resulting from a coastal section submerging under water reached a height of 5-6 m. A collapse in the mouth of the Alsek River caused a wave 1-2 m high, which spread upriver. The water level in the lower reaches dropped approximately 1 m; several hours later, the dam was breached and the shores of the river were flooded. In Glacier Bay, rocks crashed down from the steep beaches, resulting in small waves no more than 1/2-1 m (2-3 feet) high. Similar waves were observed in Dixon Harbor several minutes after the earthquake. The most catastrophic events, unique in the history of strong earthquakes, occurred in Lituya Bay, which is the T-shaped bed of an ancient glacier that has been filled in with water. The distinctive feature of the bay is the strong tidal currents at the throat, reaching 12 knots in velocity. At the time of the earthquake, about 300 million square meters of rock collapsed into Gilbert Bay from the northeast shore. The water extruded from the bay by the collapsing mass, splashed up on the opposite shore, reaching a colossal height. The movement of the water was so fast, that it uprooted a whole forest in the flood zone and stripped the bark and branches from the trees. Besides this gigantic splash, the collapse of this huge mass gave rise to a wave, which crossed the entire Lituya Bay from Gilbert Bay to the sea with a velocity of 150-200 km/hr, that is, with the speed of gravity waves, and devastated the shores of Lituya Bay. The tectonic dislocations in the source of the earthquake, and possibly the wave emerging from Lituya Bay, gave rise to a small tsunami, which was registered on remote tide gauges (Reference #415).
<P>The main mass of the slide, as outlined on figure 16, is a prism of rock that is roughly triangular in cross section, with dimensions of 2,400 feet and 3,000 foot along tho slope, a maximum thickness of about 300 feet normal to the slope, and a center of gravity at about 2,000 foot altitude. From those dimensions and an assumed specific gravity of 2.7, the volume and weight of tho rock mass are, respectively, <B>40 million cubic yards and 90 million tons</B>. It is highly probable that this entire mass plunged into Gilbert Inlet as a unit at the time of the earthquake, although tho only known fact is that it fell between about noon on July 7 and about 10 .m on July 10.

<P>1931, October 4, 1931 6:15 [local time]. Validity 4. There was an earthquake on San Cristobal Island. It was apparently incomparably stronger than all other earthquakes in the memory of the European settlers. A tidal wave appeared (in Tuilagi) about 10 minutes after the earthquake on the 4th. At Kira Kira, the rise of water was about 2 m, but since it was ebb tide, the water rose only to the high tide mark, without doing any <B>damage except to one recently built stone moorage</B>, which had already been partly destroyed by the earthquake. 
<P>This wave was observed along the entire northern coast of San Cristobal, being somewhat larger in the eastern part of the shore and gradually diminishing to nothing in the direction to the western tip of the island. 
<P>At Port Mary (Santa Ana Island), the water retreated a very large distance, and then, after a brief pause, rose quickly and reached the highest high tide mark. This cycle of movements, which required about a minute for its completion, recurred three times with diminishing amplitude. According to depth measurements made after the sea had calmed down, the lowest level reached by the water was about 3.5 m below the lowest low tide mark, so that the total rise and fall of water was about 5.5 m.
<P>Judging by available data, on the south cast of San Cristobal Island, between Cape Surville and Cape Sydney, the water first retreated from shore some distance beyond the lowest low tide mark (it was ebb tide) and then returned and rose, and the water surface became like a wall, which arose at the edge of the reefs. This wall advanced on land like a monolith, carrying away everything in its path. The cycle recurred three times.
<P>The highest level reached was clearly marked on the trees which withstood the onslaught of the water and at most places was about 6 m above the high high tide mark, although at the center of the affected area, whether because the disturbance of the surface of the water nearby was greater, or because of the shore configuration, the level reached was at least 9 m above the high water mark.

Fifteen minutes after the first wave a second wave moved in from the southwest with a height of 11 m. It destroyed the structures on the sandspit and in southwestern part of Ust'-Kamchatsk, passed up the river to the Ozernaia tributary and heaped up fragments of buildings and ice in it. The Kamchatka River was opened about a km and a half above its mouth; a new mouth was formed alongside the former one. <P>The old Denby cannery and the storehouses with goods and products were destroyed and in part washed into the ocean. Eighteen men were killed. The building of the radio-station survived but it was crammed with chunks of ice. The new Denby cannery suffered only in part.

The ebb and flow int he river continued for a considerable time. <P>At first there was no information concerning the fate of the Tsutsumi and Nichiro canneries (it was impossible to get to them as the water had poured out over the tundra and the snow was greatly thinned out). At one plant was seen a heap of wreckage, the other was covered with masses of ice. <P>On April 23 two Japanese, workers of the Tsutsumi cannery, came to Berezovy Yar. They had had to flee 2.5 km from the wave, which advanced with a great noise. They were saved only thanks to the fact that the wave was held back by the deep snow. Thereafter the Japanese wandered for eight days over the flooded tundra without food or sleep until they stumbled onto the settlement. <P>In summer it was found out that both factories were completely destroyed. On the whole, as Troshin and Diagliev indicate, the tsunami extended along the northwest coast of the Gulf of Kamchatka from Cape Shubert to Perevoloka [an extension of the Denby sandpit, it separates Lake Nerpich'e from the Gulf of Kamchatka]. In the area of First Creek the wave had the greatest height. Wreckage from the Nichiro cannery was carried up the valley of that creek. One of the cannery's cutters was thrown across a low coastal terrace about 1 km. broad and dropped on a slope at a height of about 20 m. In the valley trees were torn up by the roots over a distance of 7-8 km. <P>On the banks of Second Creek the destruction was on a smaller scale. Here the wave extended not more than 4.5 km from the mouth. To the northeast of First Creek, inthe area of the Tsutsumi cannery, the wave passed to the north over the tundra only 4km, and Ust'-Kamchats, which is 1 km from the shore of the sea, was affected only on the southwest. Farther east towards Perevoloka the wave was still smaller. The radio station and cannery No. 1 suffered only on the side facing the sea. At Perevoloka the wave was no bigger than a storm wave; drifting timbers and sea week were thrown up on shore 50-70 m.

There was a very strong earthquake in the southern part of Atacama province, with a zone of destruction approximately from Copiapo to Coquimbo. The instrumental and macroseismic epicenters were fixed at sea in the region of Vallenar - Huasco. This tsunami generating earthquake began with relatively weak, but comparatively rapidly intensifying oscillations, lasting from 1/2 to 8 minutes according to different estimates. The earthquake was preceded by strong foreschocks, felt on the 3rd and 7th of November. Seismic activity in the focal zone of the earthquake was high for two months.
<P>At Chanaral, the tsunami began an hour after the earthquake and lasted about 4 hours. The sea surged onshore three times. It rose 9 m above the high tide mark, destroyed 14 homes, and carried four homes inland (there was no destruction resulting directly from the earthquake here). The tides were calm, but prolonged.
<P>At Caldera the sea at first remained completely calm after the earthquake, but then it rose: 15 minutes, 30 minutes, or 45 minutes after the earthquake, according to different estimates. The most reliable in this respect, is the report of a witness, who at the time of the earthquake was on a ship riding in the harbor, and who set off for the port in a boat immediately after the strong shocks had ceased. When the boat arrived at shore 15 minutes later, the water had risen about 5 m above the high tide level and almost splashed over the moorage.
<P>At Coquimbo, the sea was absolutely quiet before the earthquake. About 2 hours after the earthquake, a tsunami appeared. The waves spread from the northeast to the southwest along the axis of the bay, passed along the western and eastern shores, but did not cause any damage. On the south shore, the water rose to a considerable height. Three large tidal waves were observed, the third being the most destructive. The water penetrated 2 km at the most low-lying places, and the rise was 5 m above the maximum high tide line or 6 m above the mean sea level. It reached 7 m above mean sea level at the railway quay. The water rose and fell slowly; the ebb was smaller than the flood; the surface of the water was calm.

<P>March 2, 1933 (March 3, Japanese time). This wave followed a very great earthquake off the eastern, or Sanriku, coast of the main Japanese island of Honshu.
The earthquake damage was moderate, but the tsunami was devastating. In places the waves rose as high as 75 feet. 
Miyabe investigated the times of arrival of the waves as recorded on mareograms. At such distant points as San Francisco, Honolulu, Iquique, times of arrival check well enough for a wave starting from the earthquake epicenter at
about the time calculated as origin time from seismograms (which is good to within a very few seconds). However, the times recorded at Japanese tide stations are in part anomalous; at some of the more distant stations the tsunami was actually recorded as beginning 20 minutes earlier than at the nearest ones. This discrepancy may be due in part to seiches started by the seismic waves in the ground; Miyabe prefers to conclude that the tsunami probably did not originate from a point. In so great an earthquake, which almost certainly involved extensive faulting or block movement, this is to be expected. Omote proposes that there was an earlier wave originating around the margin of an area several hundred kilometers wide and a later wave from a more limited source of the order of 10 kilometers in diameter. An interesting detail was the recording at tide stations in Australia and New Zealand of waves, reflected from the American coast, traveling twice across the Pacific in about 47 hours.

<P>On December 21, 1946, at 4:19 [local time] there was a catastrophic earthquake on the southwest of Japan in the Nankai area. The number of homes destroyed directly by the earthquake was 2,598; 1,443 people died. In addition, 1,451 homes were washed away by the ensuing tsunami waves.<P>A sizeable tsunami rolled onto the coast of the Kii Peninsula and Shikoku Island. The tsunami was strongest on the east coast of Kii Strait, from Fukuro to Mio, where the rise of water was 6 m. The rise was slightly less on the western coast of the strait, and increased from south to north (from 2-3 to 4.5-5 m). In Tosa Bay, the maximal rise
of water was observed in the Susaki region, where it also reached 5 m, but the impact of the tsunami was considerably weaker here than in the Kii Strait.<P>According to visual observations, the first wave was the highest at Sinjo and Kanno'ura, while the second wave was the highest at most other points, and the third was highest far into Susaki Gulf. The records for the tide gauges situated on the eastern shore of the Kii Strait, showed that the tsunami began here with an ebb, which was followed by a large rise in the water level.<P>The following is known about the effects of the tsunami at individual points. On both shores of the entrance to Yura Bay (at Katakui, Okui, Kashiwa and west of Kamiya), the rise of water was 2.7-2.8 m. According to residents, the tsunami advanced slowly here, and the water rose gradually; at Katakui, the sea bottom was exposed. East of the Kashiwa-Itoya line, the rise of water increased markedly, reaching 3.9 m at Yura and Fukui, and 4-4.2 m at the head of the bay.<P>At Tokushima, the water rose only 1.5 m and the incursion did no damage. The rise of water increased towards the head of Akaishi Bay, which constricts in a southwestern direction. At Komatsushima, it was only 1.7-1.9 m (possibly due to the protection of the breakwater) and at Yokosu, the water did not cross a dike 2 m high, but between Kanaiso and Akaishi, it even flowed across a dike 3 m high. At Akaishi, the water rose 2.8-2.9 m. The tsunami approached Akaishi in the form of a step, and the run-up was rather strong. No little damage was done: dikes were destroyed, homes were flooded, and different objects were carried away.<P>At Shishikui, partly screened from the south by a rocky cape, the rise of water on shore was 3.3 m. Protective tree stands, planted along the coast, somewhat weakened the thrust of the water, and for the most part it overflowed along the mouth of the Shishikui River. The broken surf rose up river. On the south side of this cape, the rise of water was 4.4 m. At Kanno'ura, situated somewhat to the west, the rise of water was rather high, but the coast did not suffer, except for the top of a little bay which constricts to the north. The ships in the harbor did not run aground which indicates the low speed of currents at the steep and deep shore.<P>At Kanno'ura and at Cape Muroto, according to accounts, the movement of the water began with an ebb tide. Muroto Port dried up as far as the breakwater. At Cape Muroto, both the rise of water and the wave periods were less than on other sections of the coast. At Kochi, a large area of the subsided shore was flooded with water, but the tsunami itself was very weak. The tsunami practically did not enter Urado Bay which has a narrow, long and very shallow entrance.<P>The tsunami was registered far from the source, on the coast of the Hawaiian Islands and North and South America.<P><I>See individual runup locations for more information.</i>.

The waves struck the Hawaiian Islands at 1:00 pm. Property damage from these waves in the Hawaiian Islands was estimated at $800,000 to $1,000,000; however no lives were lost. It also caused damage on the west coast of the United States and was observed on tide gauges throughout the Pacific Basin.
<P>Reference #79 lists considerable damage and considerable loss of life in the Kuril Islands.
<P>The waves of the tsunami of 4-5 November 1952 were noted from Iturup l. on the south (height of wave 2.5 m.) to the village of Shubertovo near Ust'-Kamchatsk (wave height 0.5-1 m.) and had destructive force over an extent of more than 700 km. of the Pacific coast -- from Onekotan l. on the south to the Kronotsky Peninsula (Kamchatka) on the north. The morphology of the shores and the relief of the bottoms of bays and straits played an important role in the heightening of the waves upon their arrival at the coast; waves which were imperceptible to ships on the open ocean, at the coast transformed themselves into terrible battering rams, which not only destroyed installations but changed the coastal relief, washing away sandy soils and causing landslides... The greatest destruction and suffering of 4-5 November were caused by the tsunami which arose as a result of the earthquake and which took in about 700 km of the east coasts of Kamchatka and the Kuril Is. On the average the height of the waves on the coast reached 6-7 m. In Kamchatka and on the Kuril Is. destructive sea waves appeared 30-40 minutes after the earthquake. At most points the beginning phase of the waves was accompanied by a lowering of the level of the ocean. Hence it follows that
the actual moment of appearance of the waves on the coast occurred half a period earlier. (reference #4252)
<P>Kurilske was about 15 thousand inhabitants, about 4 thousand perished, extensive destruction... (reference #9224)
<P> Because of the absence of casualties in the far field, this event was often perceived as involving a deceptive
tsunami, as no reports were available from the near field. The 1952 Kamchatka tsunami was, in fact, a closely
guarded state secret in the then-USSR, especially since we now know that it had eradicated the sensitive naval
base at Severo-Kurilsk. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, information started to slowly trickle out
in the form either of dissemination abroad of existing reports or of studies resulting from new research into this matter. Among the latter, Smyshlyaev (reference #11472) reported 7,802 civilian deaths in the Northern Kurils, and estimated that the total death toll in the city of Severo-Kurilsk, including military casualties, must have reached 10,000 and perhaps as high as 17,000, making the event by far the deadliest tsunami in the twentieth century. (reference #9223)
<P>). Present day estimates based on the existed  data on population density in the area and available damage reports from some selected coastal locations show that  minimum number of victims was about 4000 people with estimated maximum as high as 14000 fatalities (Smyshlyaev, 2003). Based on this, the most realistic estimate for the fatality level can be adopted as 10,000 people, the majority of which (more than 99%) were killed by tsunami. (reference #11763)
<P>The source of 1952 earthquake was located in two time zones. According to Greenwich (UTC), the earthquake happened on November 4 at 16 hours 58 minutes. In Kamchatka (+12 hours) at this time was November 5, 4-58 am, and in Kuril Islands, which live in Sakhalin time (+11 hours) was 3-58 am. So, local people from Severo-Kurilsk use the time 4 am for the earthquake (reference #12048)

An earthquake on December 26, 1939 in Turkey between Erzincan and Erzurum caused a small tsunami in the Black Sea. In Fatsa, a harbor on the Black Sea coast of Turkey, the sea receded 50 m from the shore. Then the sea dashed up the shore as far as 20 m above the normal water level [inundation]. The wave action slowly diminished until the sea returned to its normal state. A small tsunami reached the Black Sea coast of the [former] USSR and was recorded by tide gauges. These waves were recorded by almost all of the tide gauge stations on the Black Sea coast of the Crimea and the Caucasus.  The tsunami began with the rise of the sea level in all places except Batumi. Batumi was the nearest [former] USSR tide gauge to the epicenter of the earthquake. The comparison of the calculated wave travel-time data with the observed
data suggests that the source of the tsunami should have been either on the shore of the Black Sea near the coast of Turkey, between Batumi and Sinop, or inland. It is difficult to say anything definite about the mechanism of generation of this tsunami. It is not known whether it was
generated by tectonic movement, or as that of a secondary phenomena, such as the landslide pointed out by B. Gutenberg Gutenberg, 1939] in 1939 in connection with the Atacama earthquake on November 11, 1922. (reference #2778)"

This shock, the largest felt in this region since the 1716 event, had the epicenter  located very close to the coast (about 4 km) and the earthquake produced severe damage and more than 2,000 victims. Two main phenomena were associated to the earthquake: shoreline uplift along 50 km and a tsunami, triggered either by the earthquake itself or by a submarine landslide. According to Dr. Yelles, director of the CRAAG center in Algiers, the tsunami waves were generated by a river sediment slide. In fact, the area is well known for a large sediment deposited by a river, a deposit which is highly unstable. Instantaneously with the Zemmouri earthquake, a tsunami was generated along the northern Algerian coasts. No run-up values were reported along the Algerian coasts, indicating that the tsunami waves, if any, were not high enough to inundate beyond original shoreline.

An average regional uplift of 0.55 m was measured along the shoreline in the epicentral area. Field observations, main shock and aftershocks characteristics are consistent with thrust along a &#8764;55-km-long rupture, trending NESW, dipping SE. The seismotectonic parameters indicate a hypocentre 78 km deep and a possible fault break between 5 and 15 km offshore.

3-4 m in west-facing bays on the islands, and on the mainland coast immediately east of Boiken.
The higher run-up in the west-facing bays was a funneling effect. In both Victoria Bay and Mushu Bay, the larger of the west-facing bays on Mushu Island, observers saw the water circulate counter clockwise around the perimeter of the bay, and reach maximum height in the eastern extremity of each bay. Logs were washed ashore amongst the houses at Buruwan on Victoria Bay and 50 m of land was inundated. Logs, coral and a moored dinghy were washed ashore in Mushu Bay. The reason for the higher run-up east of Boiken is less clear, but perhaps was due to the funneling of the tsunami between the coast and the islands. Tsunami effects were observed as far east as Murik Lakes; where water washed through the villages at ankle depth. The villages are on a low sand bar. In the west, a repeated rising and falling of the water level in the Aitape River of the order of 1 m above normal water level was observed at 6.45 to 7 am. In Wewak too, there was a fluctuation of the sea level at 6:45-7 am, the water draining out into the bay then returning passively to flood across the road, before subsiding to normal level. The drop in sea level was estimated to be 2 m, and the rise above normal sea level, 1.5-2 m. The fluctuations at 6:45 am appear to have been a second and discrete tsunami event.

In the area of maximum damage from earthquake shaking, between Boiken and the mouth of Hawain River, the tsunami was reported to have had turbulent, violent flow. At Victoria Bay at the eastern end of Kairiru Island, the tsunami was observed to approach from the southwest and swirled along the cost with an anti-clockwise motion depositing large logs and other debris. At these locations and on both northern and southern coasts of Muschu Island houses were swept away by the tsunami.

<P>On 15 June 1995, 00:16 GMT, a strong (Ms=6.0) earthquake ruptured the western side of the Corinthos Gulf. The earthquake caused extensive damage in several towns and villages along both coastlines of the Gulf, the northern and the southern ones. The maximum intensity (VII+) was felt in the city of Aegion, southern coastline, where the collapse of two multi-storied buildings caused a death toll of 26. Extensive coastal ground breaks and subsequent ground submergence were reported in both coastlines. In the northern coastline, a local tsunami wave was officially reported from the town of Eratini (peak-to-trough 1.5 m) being located in the epicentral area. The wave was observed immediately after the earthquake occurrence. Its maximum vertical run-up was of about 004-0.5 m, while a water withdrawal of about 1 m occurred a few minutes after the earthquake. The water disturbance lasted for about 12 hours. Damage was not reported. Judging from that no tsunami was reported from other coastal places of the epicentral or more remote areas it is tentatively concluded that the wave could be attributed to the reported massive sliding in the sea of unconsolidated sediments accumulated at the local river mouth. A similar mechanism of tsunamigenesis at the same place was considered in association with the earthquake (Ms=6.3) of 6 July 1965. Tsunami generation from either seismic or aseismic sliding of coastal or submarine sediment masses is rather frequent in the Greek Archipelago, including the Gulf of Corinthos. (reference #2278)

<P>At 7:10 p.m. on November 3, 1994, a large tsunami generated by a massive landslide in the submerged Skagway River delta occurred near Skagway, Alaska, resulting in one fatality and damaging or destroying many harbor structures. At first, it was theorized by some that construction activity in the harbor caused the initial landslide. However, this paper presents the findings of an in-depth scientific investigation that concludes that such a theory is impossible. The findings paint a clear picture of the failure of the submerged Skagway River delta that was overloaded by flood sediments and exacerbated by river diking. Slide volumes estimated at over 20,000,000 cubic yards that consisted of a massive initial slide and subsequent retrogressive earth slides produced the tsunami that caused the fatality and destroyed or damaged harbor structures.

<P>A negative tide of 1.2 m at 7:10 pm local time was the probable cause of a submarine landslide-generated tsunami that caused about $25 million damage and one fatality in Skagway Harbor, Alaska. It produced a tsunami of nine to eleven meters. Because the event was not associated with an earthquake, there was about a year delay before the tsunami community became aware of the event.
<P><blockquote><i>Reference #234:</i></blockquote>

The time between waves varied and at Coishco was reported near 8 min, at La Posa Huanchaco 9 minutes, at Playa Chimus 25 minutes. Many interviewees noted that during (and after) the
tsunami the water became more turbulent, with bigger waves and a dirtier appearance. In El Dorado and Puerto Supe, eyewitnesses pointed to rocks and dock structures beyond which the water withdrew first. A number of eyewitnesses noted that the water remained high (or ponded) for 2-3 days.

A magnitude 7.1 Ms (Mw 7.1) (HRV) earthquake at 19:15 UT in the Verde Island Passage between Luzon and Mindoro Islands, Philippine Islands caused at least 87 dead and missing due to the earthquake and tsunami on Mindoro Island. Most of the casualties were children. Two hundred thirty-five people were injured. On Mindoro 797 houses were destroyed and 3,288 damaged and seven more houses were destroyed at Batangas, Luzon.
<P>An international survey team with members from Korea, Thailand, the United States, and Philippines surveyed the tsunami effects on Mindoro from Calapan Bay to Subaang Bay, the southeastern coast of Luzon near Lobo, and the islands in the passage of Verde, Baco Island, Silonay Island and Anaganahao Island. A local tsunami occurred with a maximum runup of 7.3 meters on the southwest coast of Baco Island at Sitio Pino and 6.1 meters on the northern coast. Eyewitnesses reported the water first receded 45 meters. There were no deaths on Baco Island and only one home
destroyed. Three waves were reported with the second being the highest.
<P>The tsunami produced a sound on its return like that of a landing jet airplane. It had heights of 1.5 to 4.0 meters along the northern Mindoro coast. One effect was the breaking loose of a moored, 4,000-ton barge in the Baruyan River sweeping it 1.6 km upstream. The wave penetrated upstream about two kilometers. This happened before the first tectonic tsunami wave reached the Mindoro coast and
must have been due to a local landslide generated tsunami.
<P>The heights ranged from 2.3 to 4.2 meters along the Luzon coast near Lobo. On Verde Island the maximum wave was 2.8 meters, and there was no damage or fatalities. On Mindoro Island the tsunami contributed to the damage in the Calapan and Puerto Galera areas. At Calapan the wave receded 100 meters and returned as a white line with a drumming noise. The tsunami was recorded on the marigram from Batangas, Luzon, with a height of about 20 cm. The marigraph was used to correct the runup measurements for tidal levels. The Lubang fault, the source fault, was a strike-slip fault.

A maximum run-up of 3.2 m was followed by a run-down of -5.6 m [Port of Imweon]. Most of the impact of the tsunami in South Korea occurred between Imweon and Sogcho.. During the tsunami, 100 individuals were drowned, most of them at Noshiro, Hachimori, and the Oga Peninsula. These individuals were caught on the shoreline or on offshore construction sites. Tsunami
warnings were issued approximately 14 minutes after the earthquake occurred; however, the leading wave reached the shoreline at these locations at approximately the same time.
In Korea, three deaths were attributed to the tsunami. Since the tsunami reached the Korean shoreline approximately 1-1/2 hours after the earthquake occurred, these deaths could have been prevented... In Korea, over 70 ships were damaged by the tsunami... Many coastal flood protective structures were severely damaged during
the tsunami. For example, concrete armor units weighing 4 metric tons were moved hundreds of feet inland near the area of maximum run-up. In addition, many levees and seawalls were overtopped and damaged. These protective structures were designed for storm waves and were unable to accommodate the waves produced by the tsunami.

The earthquake and tsunami associated with it were responsible for the destruction of at least six fishing villages and the death of hundreds of people in the Narino State of Colombia. At least 15 other coastal towns in the area were rocked by the earthquake and were damaged by the waves. Waves measuring anywhere from 2-5 meters destroyed many of these coastal villages. People along the coast, who survived the earthquake by running outside their homes, were carried away a few minutes later by the large tsunami waves generated by the earthquake. Six fishing boats, one with 40 men aboard, were lost. A pier on the prison island of Gorgona was destroyed, however, no injuries from either the earthquake or the tsunami were reported from there. Most of the houses at Charco, a village of 4,000 which were built on stilts over a lake were knocked into the water. Waves sent the Iscuande River out of its banks along the Pacific coast. The wall of water reportedly in the village of Iscuande caused extensive damages. At least one person was reported dead from that area.
<P>Hardest hit of all the coastal villages was the fishing village of San Juan, where the waves completely overran the island destroying just about everything in their path. Numerous deaths were reported from San Juan which was totally devastated and is in the process of being relocated further inland at the present time. According to eyewitness reports, 3 to 4 waves were observed, the first wave arriving approximately 10 minutes after the main earthquake. The water recessed first to about 3 meters below the level of the sea. The first wave arrived minutes later. The third wave was the largest, and at San Juan Island it was approximately 5 meters above the level of the tide, which fortunately, was at its lowest at that time.
<P>The maximum difference between low and high tide in the region for that time of the year was approximately 1.3 meters, thus, the maximum wave could have been that much more, if it had arrived at high tide, and numerous more deaths could have resulted. Considering that the mean elevation of the coastal islands is approximately 2 to 2.5 meters above high tide, it would mean that maximum waves would have completely overrun all of the coastal islands in the area. Approximately 30-35 km of the coast was hardest hit by the tsunami, while the length of the area hardest hit by the earthquake was approximately 225 km in length, from Guapi to Tumaco.
<P><B>It is estimated that the majority of casualties (at least 80%) were the result of the tsunami rather than of the earthquake.

A catastrophic earthquake shook Sumbawa Island. It covered an extensive area from the southern coast of Indonesia to the northwestern coast of Australia. A large tsunami was produced. The first press reports announced waves 30 m high in Indonesia and 8 m high in Australia Apparently, these figures were exaggerated. A group from the International Tsunami Information Center
visited the coastal regions of Sumba, Sumbawa, Lombok and Bali Islands to assess the destruction and wave run-ups, and to obtain other detailed information from local people. Inaccessible areas on the southern coast of Sumba and
Sumbawa islands were photographed from the air. Information was processed that had been gathered by the Indonesian military, search and rescue parties, provincial administration, and by medical teams visiting accessible areas in the coastal villages to offer help and assess the extent of loss of property and life. These records were supplemented by radio broadcast accounts from individual
settlements. <P>The southern coasts of the islands, with the exception of Bali, is sparsely populated. Villages are generally small and scattered. Hence the loss of human life was not high. According to incomplete data, over 180 people were killed and 3,900 were left homeless. Fishing boats and equipment were lost. For a large part of the Indonesian territory, which had sustained heavy damage from the tsunami, no information is available on the height of the rise in the water level. However, in the accessible region of Sumbawa Island, preliminary information reported that the tsunami reached a height of at least 15 m above the
high-tide mark and inundated the island up to 500 m inland.
<P>According to eyewitness accounts, the tsunamis appeared on the Indonesian coast about an hour or two after high tide, beginning with an ebb, which soon left a 100-200 m wide drained belt. This was followed by three large waves with a period of about 5 min or less. The first wave was the
highest and most ferocious. Several witnesses noted the duration of agitation of the sea although most made no mention of it. An unusual phenomenon occurred during the time interval between the earthquake and the arrival of the tsunami. Residents of villages in the Sumbawa and Lombok Islands thrice heard a sound at intervals estimated from a few seconds to 1 min and more. It was diversely described as sounding like a bomb explosion or a sonic boom. The sound
reportedly emanated from the epicentral area. Nearly every village reported that the water became black and some reported a rise in temperature and an unpleasant smell. The tsunami reached a height of more than 10 m along the coast of Sumbawa. The main destruction was observed on the Sumbawa and Lombok islands.<P>The tsunami was also observed on the northern and western coasts of Australia. It was reported that on-the Australian coast, as on the Indonesian coast, three waves appeared, the first being the largest. Agitation of the sea continued for several hours. In Dampier the wave reached a height of 2 m; in Port Sampson it varied from 2 to 4 m; in Cape Leveque it reached 6 m. The arrival of the tsunami coincided with an observable ebb and a low tide in many places. These factors weakened the overall effect of the tsunami. Evidently, no lives were lost in Australia although there was one report of a person drawn into the sea by waves.<P>(above from reference #417)
<P>A magnitude 8.0 Ms earthquake south of Sumbawa Is generated a tsunami that completely destroyed several villages. At least 100 people were killed, 89 reported missing and 75 injured. Most of the casualties and damage were caused by the tsunami. (reference #1053).

At Scilla the sea withdrew for more than 10 meters leaving the sea bottom dry and a lot of fish on the beach; then suddenly the water came back surpassing its usual limit of about 1,5 meters and flooding the coast. Oscillation repeated with period of 15 minutes. 
At Messina the sea overpassed the quays, destroying them, and violently inundated the theathre Marittimo. Sea agitated for three days after the main shock. At Torre del Faro, sea retreat followed by inundation observed. The water of the two marshes, Pantano Piccolo and Pantano Grande, receded). The sea coming back, partly destroyed the lighthouse and penetreted as far as the two marshes, inundating wineyards, then withdrew dragging many boats livestock and leaving fish on shore. The sea receding dragged some fishermen. At Catona the sea flooded the coast for a short stretch. At Reggio Calabria the sea surpassed the beach arriving at the coastal road inundating some twon district. At San Gregorio a rockfall fell into the sea generating sea waves. In the stretch of coast from Bianco to Roccella Ionica (about 35 km long) the beach was flooded by about one mile. At Roccella the wave was observed about 7 minutes after the shock.

It generated a tsunami that ""caused severe destruction in the [Stromboli] island, produced some damage in the Aeolian archipelago, and was observed in several coastal places in the south-Tyrrhenian sea"" (Reference #2439).
<P>On 30 December at 1315 and 1322 two landslides suddenly formed along the Sciara del Fuoco. As they traveled down the volcano's flank they produced wet, fine ashfall (less than 0.1 mm in size) on the island's SE side. The first landslide had a volume of about 600,000 m3, the second about 5,000,000 m3, and they both reached the sea. Upon contact with the sea the landslides produced two tsunamis with waves that were several meters high. The tsunamis injured few people, and damaged buildings and boats in the villages of Stromboli and Ginostra. Large waves were reported as far away as the town of Milazzo, on Sicily's N coast, 60 km S of Stromboli... According to several news articles, volcanic activity at Stromboli on 30 December caused a landslide, which entered the sea and generated a tsunami. The articles stated that in the small village of Ginostra, waves injured six people, and damaged homes and boats. Residents and tourists were evacuated to nearby Sicily. (reference #2432)
<P>During the last months of 2002 Stromboli was dominated by an intense explosive activity that lasted till December 28. On that day Stromboli started a new effusive phase that compromised the stability of the Sciara del Fuoco flank leading to the landslides of December 30. It has been ascertained that two different landslides occurred in that day. The first one occurred at 13:15 and it was mainly a submarine one, whereas the second one, occurred 7-8 min later and produced a subaerial scar on the Sciara del Fuoco at a height of 500 m a.s.l., for a volume of about 7-8 million cubic meters. The mass moved by the first landslide was much greater than the sub-aerial one, and bathymetric surveys revealed that the total volume of the material moved by the two slides was about 20 million cubic meters. According to Tinti both landslides produced tsunami waves: the first event was characterized by a first negative sea movement, while the second produced a positive wave. The submarine slide caused a sea level lowering of about 10-15 m at the foot of the Sciara, immediately propagating in both directions, northward towards Piscità and southward towards Ginostra. A destructive tsunami, starting with an initial slow withdrawal, violently invested the northern coasts of  the island with three-four big waves. It has been ascertained that within a few minutes the water invaded Ficogrande beach, and attacked Punta Lena and Scari producing severe damage. The second tsunami was generated around 13:22 by a subaerial mass failure. Only a few people were able to distinguish the arrival of the second tsunami and to recognize the positive leading wave, while most considered it as the continuation of the first. Several field surveys were undertaken soon after the event both in the near and far-field. The strongest tsunami effects were observed at Stromboli. In the beach called Spiaggia Longa (north-eastern coast) the highest value of runup (10.90 m) was measured. At Piscità the buildings located near the shore were seriously damaged. (reference #4139)"

Bedosti (ref #9286) hypotesises that a possible cause is a submarine landslide beneath the 200 m isobath more or less between Termoli and Vasto. Mosetti (anonymous)also suggests the occurrence of a submarine landslide in the Adriatic sea. 
The following information is taken from Bedosti (ref #9286).
The oscillations period was about 10-15 minutes.
At Giulianova the sea withdrew by about 50 m at 11h 59m am and it came back 6 min later surpassing the normal level by about 60 cm. Oscillations repeated many times with period of 15 min and amplitude of 60 cm in the harbour until 5h 30m pm.
At Ortona only one oscillation observed, starting at 11h 30m am with a withdrawal of 15 m. The water came back at 12h. 
At Bisceglie the sea withdrew by 2-3 m at 6h 30m and then it flooded the beach by  200 m. The maximum height was 50 cm. Two fishing boats broke their mooring.
At Molfetta at 5.00 am 10 m of withdrawal. The period was 5 min. 
Anomalous oscillations also observed at Fossacesia, Vasto, Termoli, Campomarino and Trani at different times. 

Some newspapers report detailed description of the phenomenon:
At Termoli the sea withdrew for tens of metres leaving the harbour dried and then violently came back; some swimmers referred that the sea water suddenly became cold and immediately after became also turbolent and strongly agitated (Anonymous).
At Bari the sea water suddenly witdrew many times leaving the seafloor dried; some moored ships in the harbour went aground and some fish was found on the beach (Anonymous). 
Parenzan (ref #9287) reports that at Bari and Vieste the sea suddenly withdrew for about 50-100 m leaving boats aground and after a few minutes the sea violently inundated the shore with very high waves, causing damage to the boats and some injured people. The sea water swept away the beach-umbrellas.
In many islands and places along the Yugoslavian coasts the sea water suddenly rose; at Vela Luka (Cursola island) the waves was 8 m high inundating the first floors of  all the buildings on the shore. Many ships suffered severe damage and the sea water flooded the cost for 650 m inland (Anonymous)

On December 17 at about midday a great earthquake (40 deg 49 min N 14 deg 26 min E) occurred and a large crack on the flank facing the sea caused a huge flow; in the meantime the sea withdrew for three times and then inundated the beach furiously.

The level of the water near the fortress walls in Civitavecchia decreased by three palms of the hand. (reference #2130)
<P>The most significant of these tsunamis seems to be that occurred in December 1631 during the great Vesuvian eruption (16-18 December) that was observed in the entire Gulf of Naples from Ischia to Sorrento and that began with a remarkable water withdrawal of more than 1000 yards followed by waves invading the coasts deep inland[...] The tsunami is depicted in the chronicles by Braccini (1632) and Giuliani (1632) who gave reports rather consistent with each other as regards the event time, the water first receding and then invading the coast three times, the vessels damaged and the boats destroyed[...] The generation mechanism of the Vesuvian tsunamis is not easy to define. There is no obvious relationship between the eruption magnitude and the magnitude of the ensuing tsunami[...] The hypothesis of a tsunami induced by an earthquake associated with the eruptive phases is not convincing too, since there is no sound evidence that the 1631 was immediately preceded by a shock the size needed to generate a tsunami. Subaerial or submarine landslides can be excluded. (reference #3347)
<P>The cause- effect relationship between eruptive phenomena and the tsunami is not clear. However, the retreat of the waters did not seem to be linked to the nuees ardentes entering the sea, because authors reported that the nuees ardentes overflow from the crater was strictly contemporaneous with sea withdrawal.

great waves made the ships anchored there dash one against another so furiously that it appeared as if all would be smashed to pieces; and the sea changed many colors. I was told by our captain that he had never seen the like before..

The epicentral area was located inland about 100 km from the Tevere river mouth.

This conviction is supported by the fact that the information on the withdrawal is reported only by Baglivi [ref #10545]: ""...at the time of the second shock they say that the latin sea it the mouth of the Tevere river near the harbour, wandered away from the shore just for a little; at the end of the earthquake the water immediately came back"".

Strong inundation and shipwrecks In the middle of autumn of 1344 A.D. many and violent earthquakes occurred in Constantinople. One of the strongest shock occurred on  October 14th (some authors report the shock on October 18th). In Constantinople many houses and most of the city walls collapsed. During the shock a great wave inundated the shore for a great distance, for more than one mile. In some places the wave swept away a number of vessels that were in the harbour or sailing near the coast, and crashed them on land. <B>Many people perished.</B> When the sea retired, a lot of fish were left on the beach (Gregorash, reference #10878). According to Antonopoulos (reference #26) the maximum inundation was about 2 km. (reference #4139)"

coast at approximately 14h; the water covered the parapet of the pier. An offshore current followed immediately after the wave with such a force that the fishing boats near the port were carried out into the open sea. Then the currents
weakened gradually and ceased altogether by 07h on the following day, i.e. on April 25. According to a report of the director of the weather bureau in Heracleon, the sea currents had a velocity of about 6 knots.
<P>The water receded from the coast by approximately 1.5 m as a result of a lowering of the sea level in Nafplio at 14'30m. The reverse flow appeared several minutes later, and the normal level was exceeded by 0.5 m. Then, the water receded again, and the level returned into its usual position. According to accounts, a similar phenomenon took place on the shore of Tolo, 12 km from Nafplio.
<P>Judging from the onset time of the tsunami in various places, the source of waves more or less coincided with the focus of the main earthquake on April 22 and with its aftershock on April 24, the data on which were given above. But the waves, apparently, began 5 hours after the shock. It can therefore be assumed that they were caused by a powerful underwater landslide. (reference #2130)"

This earthquake occurred in the small and not very sensitive zone of Gerace-Siderno, on the southeast coast of Calabria. Violent earthquakes connected with the zone are those of 1720 Sep. 12, 1783 July 29, 1784 Oct. 14, and 1806 Oct. 6. At Gerace, the earthquake of 1784 was regarded as stronger than the great earthquake of 1783 Mar. 27. 
<P>The earthquake of 1907 occurred during an epoch of comparative calm in the whole of Calabria. It was, however, heralded by five shocks within the Gerace zone, on 1905 Sept. 9 and 26, 1906 Jan. 16, 1907 May 25 and Oct. 23, 9.25 p.m. The disastrous earthquake closely followed the last shock, at 9.28 p.m...  
<P>The epicentral area, within which the intensity was 9,
was very small, and included only one town (Ferruzzano), where many houses collapsed almost completely, and <B>158 persons, or 8% of its population, were killed</B>. How rapidly the intensity declined outwards is evident from the fact that at Bruzzano Zefferio, only 13 miles from Ferruzzano, no houses were ruined and no lives were lost. The total disturbed area was about 41,000 sq miles.
<P>In the central area, the shock lasted from 1O to 12 sec. The movement was continuous throughout, and varied but s1ightly in strength.
<P>Though perfectly calm at the time of the earthquake, the
sea soon afterwards advanced about 130 yd. over the shore, the seawaves being perceptible along the coast for about six miles from Capo Bruzzano to the river Careri. The waves left traces of their passages on the mareograms at Messina and Catania, the record at the former place being interrupted by the stopping of the driving clock at 9.28 p.m. At Catania, the first movements were recorded
at 9.48 p.m., the last at 6 a.m. on Oct. 24. The amplitude of the largest oscillations was about 4 in. As in the earthquake of 1905, the velocity of the seawaves (325 ft. per sec.) was distinctly less than that in a sea of the same mean depth throughout (394 ft. per sec.).

<P>1907, October 23, 21h28m. Calabrian Arc, Calabria, the shore of the Ionian Sea. A destructive earthquake occurred near the mountain ridge of Aspromonte. It was felt throughout Calabria and in the eastern part of Sicily. The sea, which had previously been absolutely calm within the focal area, penetrated deep onto dry land for 30 - 80 m over a distance of 10 - 20 km between Cape Brutzano and the River Careri and then it receded farther than its usual limits. The period of level oscillations was 10 min. (reference #2130)
<P>Strong earthquake occurred in land, about 15 km from the coast. The most damaged village was Ferruzzano. Area with heavy damage quite wide, including S.Ilario Jonico, Bianco, Bovalino, Ardore, S.Luca, Platì, Africo, Brancaleone and Bova. Severe damage suffered by  villages in the Ionian coast, from Melito Porto Salvo to Gerace.  Felt in the whole Calabria and in eastern Sicily. Number of victims is 167 (158 at Ferruzzano). More than 90 injured.
A tsunami followed the earthquake.
The sea flooded the beach by about 30 m for a stretch of about 10 km, between Capo Bruzzano and Careri River. Then it came back to its usual level (Mercalli, r193; Eredia, r194; Cavasino, r188, Righi (r617). 
Tide-gauge records of Messina and Catania were analyzed by Platania (r195).

A strong earthquake occurred in Central Greece, preceded by shocks that started in the middle of July. It embraced the isthmus of Corinth and the shore of the Gulf of Corinth. Two vertical and several wavy horizontal movements followed the thunderous boom which lasted several tens of seconds. These movements were not sharp shocks, but a slow rising and subsiding. The earth rose upwards like a carpet blown by a storm. Shocks of extreme force seemed to follow the line from Galaxidi on the shore of the Gulf of Corinth toward Amfssa, Antikyma, Arahova, Delfi, Distomo, Doubia, Chrysos. Almost all the houses tumbled down in most of these settlements, as well as in the villages of Itea, Cassotis, Kastris, Pirnaki and others. Thus, port Itea was destroyed completely; not one house stood fast in Chrysos near the foot of Mt Pamassus, and 11 people were killed; there was serious destruction in Delfi; the badly constructed houses in Thermopyles crumbled down already at the first shock, and so on. The ground cracked in the vicinity of Thermopyles, and vapour came out of fissures up to 1.5 - 2 m in width. The shocks were strong in Athens, Lamia, Piraeus, Chalkida, not so strong in Corinth, Patras, Aiyion. The oscillations of the ground lasted for several hours; the earthquake was accompanied by numerous aftershocks, at least 400, lasting till August 17.

The date of the earthquake is debated. Some authors date the shock in 554 (when a destructive earthquake occurred in Costantinople), many other suggest the 558. In Cos the sea rose up to a fantastic height and engulfed all the buildings near the shore, destroying them together with their contents and inhabitants. The heaving mass was of such enormous proportions that it flung down everything there that its surging crests could not ride over (Agathias, r454).

In this paper we review the potential causes for this landslide based on an integrated study of eye witness testimony, swath bathymetry data and stability analyses. Results show that the Sokkelvik landslide was most likely triggered by intense rainfall and snowmelt, but that the main cause is associated to the load of an up to 7.5 m high embankment fill. This fill was placed at the shoreline for road construction 6 months before the landslide. Results presented herein show the importance of accounting for extreme rainfall events and groundwater flow when planning construction activity in sensitive near shore areas. (reference #11863)"

A strong wave crossed the San Juanico Strait. The water overflowed and damaged Tacloban. There were victims. Dams were destroyed at Granborengal. The source was apparently situated at open sea (Anon., 1897 a).
<P>[One can assume that this tsunami was formed as the result of the  earthquake of 19.X a 8:00 (Richter, 1963; 18.X, 23h48m; 12<sup>o</sup> N., 126<sup>o</sup> E.; M=8.1), which reached 9 degrees (X Rossi-Forel) on the eastern part of Samar Island. It caused considerable destruction at Sulat, Palapag, Catubig, Oras, Gandara, and 
Laoang, and caused numerous cracks in the ground. Strong tremors were felt at Catbalogan, on Biliran Island, at Tacloban and moderate or strong oscillations were felt in the region of Albay Bay, at Sorsogon, Tabaco, Daet, Ginaiangan, Seber, and Iloilo. The area of the tremors, which included the southeast of Luzon Island, the Visayan Sea and the north of Mindanao Island, measured 800 x 600 km. Numerous recurrent shocks were registered including one 15 minutes after the main earthquake with a maximal intensity of 8 degrees (Maso, 1908 c, 1910 a; Repetti, 1946).
